I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school. The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers. I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k. I remember buying Macys, Hecla Mining, and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better. I was over trading like a mad man. This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7$ per trade during those days. Just young and dumb not really making any money. Wasting company time so no harm no foul. \n\nIn the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k. Which was basically my life savings at that point in time. I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres (tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per)  During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia. Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes. A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary (yes even at that time). I found his aspirations of self driving, AI , robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape. I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk. I remember talking to my father in law about it. “What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia?”  Too many eggs in one basket was his response. I ended  up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia. As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could. $200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares. \n\nIt has been a great ride since then. There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares. It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel\n\nto hold this long.

Energy security and strategic materials are becoming matters of national policy, and when that happens, pricing, capital flows, and valuations change structurally.\n\nThat’s why I’m concentrated in uranium and rare earth companies that sit outside China and inside Western-aligned supply chains.\n\nMy core holdings are Energy Fuels (UUUU), Cameco (CCJ), Centrus Energy (LEU), MP Materials (MP), and Lynas (LYSDY). $300k USD invested.\n\nI chose these US/US allied companies because they represent critical choke points in supply chains that the United States and the West utilities cannot easily replace. Together, they cover uranium mining, nuclear fuel conversion and enrichment, and rare earth production and processing outside of China. China controls the majority of these rare earths and, following Venezeula, supply restrictions are only going to get worse. We’re in the hoarding era….\n\nThe recent events in Venezuela are mostly being discussed as an oil story, but I think that framing misses the larger signal. Whether oil supply increases or not is secondary. The more important takeaway is geopolitical: the United States has shown it is willing to act decisively when strategic interests are involved. That reinforces a world where energy, materials, and supply chains are increasingly treated as matters of security rather than free-market commodities.\n\nImportantly, Venezuela does not pose an oversupply risk to uranium or rare earths. These markets are nothing like oil. Uranium is heavily regulated and sold primarily through long-term contracts with utilities that plan fuel needs years in advance. Rare earths require not just mining, but complex processing infrastructure that takes a decade or more to develop. There is no mechanism for sudden supply flooding in either market.\n\nHistory supports this view. During the 2006–2007 uranium bull run, prices did not rise because of speculative demand alone. They rose because utilities realized they were under-contracted in a tightening market and rushed to secure long-term supply. Once utilities began competing for material, prices moved violently and quickly, and equities re-rated far beyond what traditional valuation models anticipated. Rare earths experienced a similar dynamic a few years later when export controls and geopolitical tension exposed how fragile global supply really was. I expect a very similar situation to take place between 2026-2028. After Venezuela, the last thing China will do is flood the market with their supply leading to a supply constraint that will enable rare earths and uranium to Sky-rocket. Just look at how commodities reacted yesterday…\n\nThose episodes weren’t driven by economic growth cycles — they were driven by procurement crises. When utilities and governments fear supply disruption, they don’t negotiate for the best price; they secure supply at almost any price.\n\nThat historical lesson matters today. Nuclear power is expanding globally, enrichment capacity is constrained, and non-China rare earth supply remains limited. At the same time, geopolitical risk is rising, not falling. If tensions escalate further — particularly around Taiwan — the immediate market reaction would likely be risk-off across all assets. But the second-order effect would be a rapid acceleration of industrial policy, subsidies, and long-term contracts favoring Western-aligned suppliers of uranium and strategic materials.\n\nI’m not positioned for a short-term commodity spike. I’m positioned for a world where governments and utilities prioritize certainty of supply over cost, just as they did in prior cycles. In those environments, uranium and rare earth equities don’t behave like normal commodities — they behave like strategic infrastructure.\n\nThat’s the bet.\n\nTLDR: Geopolitical fragmentation turns uranium and rare earths into strategic assets; history shows these markets don’t reprice gradually - they reprice violently when supply security is questioned.\n\nEdit: TRUMP on LIVE NATIONAL TELEVISION JUST ANNOUNCED THEY ARE RUNNING THE COUNTRY.

Here are the Best Takes and stocks", "selftext": "We’ve all read the news, but what are Trumps real motivations. What do you guys think he wants?\n\n1. Flooding the global oil supply will lower prices, or more importantly, give Trump additional control over  the global economy through the oil supply. This may potentially be used as a bargaining chip (e.g. to weaken Iranian, Russian, Chinese economies, or to strengthen the dollar through Tariff style manipulation and leverage). Funds like USO and UCO will be interesting to watch - personally i’m staying away. \n\n2. Not only does Venezuela hold oil, but it also holds lots of gold. While Gold is currently trading at all time highs (and many economies like BRICS have been stocking up on reserves), Trump may wish to crash the gold price to ‘reinforce’ the safety of the dollar. Or, again, he may wish to leverage control. I am holding IAUM, but may sell some to resize. Again interesting to watch. \n\n3. Some have also speculated a digital currency backed by tangible (potentially Venezuelan) assets - I don’t really buy this but its interesting nonetheless.\n\n4. US grid capacity shortages have been noticeable and heavy generators are already being rolled out to fuel Data Centres and AI Infrastructure. As mentioned by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, ‘massive fleets of diesel and gas’ generators (35GW massive) may help to bridge the gap until renewable energy / grid upgrades materialise. It would cost a huge amount to buy that much fuel, if only I could get it for free… I think CAT is a miss for other reasons, but GNRC and CMI might be good plays given this background. \n\n5. All of this can be very damaging to China, as well as the fact that China has been ‘renting’ Venezuelan resources through loans granting them rights to gold, oil and rare earth materials. While I don’t think that the Rare Earths are particularly significant, snubbing China is still useful for Trump in terms of resources and ego. There may be a rise in the likes of USAR…\n\nPersonally I believe that the gold price and ETFs will start to plateau, and pending Trumps actions, maybe even fall.\n\nOil ETFs will probably remain fairly stable until Trump does something, although I believe that stocks such as HAL or CVX would be solid investments over the next two years.\n\nDid i miss anything?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q3cmyi/what_does_trump_really_want_with_venezuela_here/", "score": 967, "num_comments": 598, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "author": "ahlornjtvn139", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q3cmyi/what_does_trump_really_want_with_venezuela_here/", "flair": "Industry Discussion", "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564210}

There is also an embargo and sanctions that still have not been lifted yet and this prevents any full scale operation there from any company but once the contracts are giving from the US treasury it can only make these companies stock go up further. I am looking at Halliburton HAL and Schlumberger SLB as I think these will both be excellent plays and will not be affected by oil prices as they don’t sell oil. SLB is the “brains” of the operation, SLB has the technology to detect all of Venezuelas remaining oil field, especially the oil in the hard to reach places and SLB plans the extraction and maps everything. No company has the technology SLB does. Halliburton HAL will be sent to repair the existing pipelines and pump. HAL will fix everything and they already have existing infrastructure in Venezuela. They will also support Chevrons drilling. I believe HAL could be profitable to hold for the next 6 - 12 months and SLB could be a good hold for the next 6 - 18 months. With these two companies you avoid the volatility of oil prices and the oil market getting flooded and prices dropping.\n\nOne refinery in particular I am looking at it Valero VLO, they specialize in refining Venezuela heavy crude products, this could be a good long term play as profits will spike significantly long term.\n\nAnother one to watch could be ConocoPhillips COP as they were an oil company involved in Venezuela many years ago and their equipment and assets were seized under the Moduro regime and are owed $10 billion because of this by Venezuela so I believe they will definitely get restitution.

As to my previous post, I'll be researching and writing up on PayPal (most upvotes). As of now, PYPL is not a long, I am looking into whether its a short or a hold, more information to come.*\n\n====================================================================\n\nWe recently got news of Maduro's capture by the US, and this is very economically important, and it's extremely important to analyze the effects of these events on holdings and other areas of the market.\n\n**Background:**\n\n*Note: Use of AI to research & write the sanction background summary. (Reviewed by me)*\n\n**2018**\n\n* The Trump administration **expanded financial sanctions** on Venezuela.\n* New executive orders **banned transactions involving Venezuelan government debt** and blocked dealings with Venezuela’s **state-issued digital currency (the “petro”)**.\n* Goal: **cut off new financing** to Nicolás Maduro’s government and limit its ability to raise money internationally.\n\n**2019**\n\n* January\\*\\*:\\*\\* The U.S. sanctioned PDVSA, Venezuela’s state oil company, effectively **blocking U.S. companies from buying Venezuelan oil** and freezing PDVSA assets in the U.S.\n* August\\*\\*:\\*\\* The U.S. **froze all Venezuelan government assets in the United States** and threatened sanctions on foreign entities that supported Maduro.\n* Impact: Venezuela’s **oil exports and government revenues collapsed**, making 2019 the most severe sanctions year.\n\n====================================================================\n\n**Goodyear Tires ($GT) Update:**\n\n**December 10, 2018:** Goodyear formally announced it was halting operations in Venezuela due to economic conditions and U.S. sanctions. They locked the gates and laid off the workforce. (1,160 employees)\n\n**December 11, 2018 (The Seizure):** The Maduro regime declared Goodyear's closure \"illegal\" and an act of \"sabotage.\" The government invoked labor laws to immediately \"occupy\" and take control of the facility in Valencia, promising to restart production under state management.\n\nIn a famous detail from the 2018 exit, Goodyear gave each laid-off employee **10 tires** as part of their severance package because the currency (Bolívar) was so worthless that tires were a more stable store of value than money. *(AI)*\n\nIf the new U.S. backed transition government returns the plant, Goodyear gains a fully-constructed industrial facility. Even if it requires $100M in refurbishment, reclaiming a facility with a value of \\~$500M+ is a huge gain for Goodyear, so I'll try to quantify this the best I can.\n\nBefore the complete economic collapse, Venezuela was a massive profit driver for Goodyear Latin America. We can look at 2014-2015 financial filings to quantify exactly what GT lost and what it could regain.\n\n* In 2014, despite early signs of crisis, Goodyear Venezuela generated **$119 million in Operating Income**.\n* In 2015, Venezuela accounted for **33% of Latin America’s net sales that year,** up from 16% in 2014, despite the broader regional sales decline caused by the Brazilian recession.\n* At the time of the 2018 seizure, union leaders reported the plant was producing **10,500 tires per day** while running at only **20% capacity**.\n   * This implies a full capacity of 52,500 tires/day or 19m tires/yr (LATAM sales volume of 18m in 2013)\n\nIts pretty clear that the restoration of this revenue stream, particularly under a stabilized currency or dollarized administrative regime, would represent a massive gain for Goodyear’s current shareholders.\n\n**The Valencia Plant**\n\nOn September 16, 2025, the Venezuelan Ministry of Industries announced a strategic partnership with international investors to allocate over €30 million (approximately $32 million) to \"reactivate and modernize\" the Valencia plant. \n\nThis investment was directed toward:   \n\n1. Technological upgrades and restoration of production lines to replace aging legacy systems.   \n2. Training the workforce in coordination with labor unions to handle state-of-the-art machinery.   \n3. Implementing advanced technology to ensure that tires produced at the site meet global quality and durability standards.   \n4. Modernization of curing and extrusion set-points to improve energy efficiency and reduce conversion costs. \n\nIt is likely focused on the most critical failure points, curing presses and Banbury mixers.\n\nIf this plant was worth \\~$USD600m in 2018, it was state-of-the art at the time, ill conservatively (see note below) estimate \\~200mm in CapEx to reinstate this immense factory that can produce all of 2013's demand alone.\n\nThe capital saved by not having to build a greenfield site (a process that would take 24–36 months) allows Goodyear to quickly capture the post-war demand surge while advancing the Goodyear Forward goal of debt reduction.\n\n*Note: Honestly, I could research further into this and get exact numbers by comparing precedent factory investments/projects from $GT and competitors to try and estimate how much investment would be needed to return this 7-Year old factory into what is needed for $GT's tires. Unfortunately, I'm writing this up on a Sunday and that'd probably take more time than I'm willing to put in for a marginal gain in thesis confidence.*\n\n**Venezuelan Supply for Tire inputs**\n\nRaw material costs typically account for 60% of total production expenses, while energy consumption during the vulcanization and curing cycles adds another 15–20%. The Venezuelan industrial corridor offers several unique advantages that could make the Valencia plant one of the lowest-cost producers in Goodyear’s global portfolio.\n\nGoodyear’s Valencia plant is located in close proximity to Negroven S.A., a carbon black producer with an installed capacity of 70,000 metric tons per year. Carbon black is a critical reinforcing filler in rubber mixtures, and Negroven has remained operational throughout the crisis, continuing to export to international markets as recently as December 19, 2025. The availability of local carbon black eliminates significant logistics costs and import duties that affect other regional plants in Brazil or Colombia.\n\nThe Trump administration’s stated goal is to \"get the oil flowing\" by deploying major U.S. oil companies to fix the country’s broken infrastructure. This revival of the domestic petroleum industry, which has seen production stagnate at around 800,000–900,000 barrels per day despite a potential for 2 million+, will provide Goodyear with a direct source of petrochemicals required for synthetic rubber and high-temperature polymers used in tire tread inserts. The involvement of Chevron and other majors ensures that the processing facilities will be modernized, reducing the volatility of chemical feedstocks for the Valencia Plant.\n\nTire manufacturing is exceptionally energy-intensive. The Guri Dam hydroelectric system provides the vast majority of Venezuela’s power. While the system has faced threats of sabotage and neglect, the Transition Governing Council has identified the securement and establishment of technical oversight for the Guri Dam as an immediate priority to prevent total electrical blackouts. A stable, low-cost hydroelectric power source would give the Valencia plant a significant competitive advantage over plants in other emerging markets that rely on expensive fossil-fuel-based electricity or unreliable grids.\n\n**There are several demand drivers that I'm happy to further discuss if not obvious that will fuel a catch-up phase in Venezuela and LATAM**\n\nIf the plant achieves its 2015 operating income of $119 million on only partial capacity, a fully utilized facility in a stable currency environment could realistically contribute $250 million to $300 million in annual segment operating income by 2028.\n\n**TLDR:** A U.S. overhaul of Venezuela is EXTREMELY bullish for $GT and completes the initial thesis. As this continues to develop, we may see incremental $USD250-300mm gain in operating income within 2 years.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q3s3kv/update_gt_goodyear_tires_maduros_capture_stock/", "score": 0, "num_comments": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.43, "author": "TheVariantView", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q3s3kv/update_gt_goodyear_tires_maduros_capture_stock/", "flair": "Company Analysis", "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564210}

The expiration pulled some EV sales forward to the third quarter for Tesla and other automakers.\n\nEven before that, the start of 2025 was a struggle for Tesla.\n\nAfter spending heavily to propel Trump back to the White House, Musk spent the first quarter of the year leading the president’s DOGE initiative to slash the federal workforce.\n\nMusk also endorsed Germany’s extremist anti-immigrant party, AfD, and later supported British anti-Muslim and anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson. In recent weeks, Musk has called to abolish the European Union.\n\nPartly in response to Musk’s incendiary rhetoric, Tesla has faced an enduring consumer backlash in Europe and the U.S. The company hasn’t fully recovered despite introducing a new, more affordable version of its Model Y SUV in October.\n\nHowever, Tesla shares still rallied in the second half of the year, jumping 40% in the third quarter, reaching a fresh record in mid-December. Musk bought $1 billion worth of shares in September.\n\nShareholders approved a new $1 trillion pay plan for Musk in November that will give the CEO more shares and increased control over the company. The vote came after Musk threatened to potentially leave Tesla if the plan didn’t pass.\n\nCritics voiced concerns that the plan doesn’t require Musk to spend a minimum amount of time on his Tesla work, and that there are no limits on his political activity.\n\nWhile Tesla doesn’t break out deliveries geographically, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) showed that the company lost market share in the region in 2025.\n\nTesla’s European registrations fell 39% in the first 11 months of 2025, while Chinese rival BYD saw registrations rise 240% in Europe. Overall, battery electric vehicles were more widely embraced in Europe in 2025, amounting to around 16% of all new vehicles sold there.\n\nSome analysts project that sales of Tesla’s more affordable Model Y standard, which the company launched in October, will help the company regain ground in coming quarters.\n\nIn a note last week, analysts at Cannacord Genuity wrote that EV adoption “is rising quickly in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil, where robust consumer interest could create meaningful long-term upside for Tesla, even as it faces fierce rivalry from Chinese automakers.”\n\nBesides BYD, Tesla now faces competition from other Chinese EV makers including Xiaomi and Geely.\n\nBut Tesla is selling investors on Musk’s vision of the future, or what he calls “sustainable abundance,” more than EV sales. That vision includes robotaxis, which Musk has promised for years, and humanoid robots, which he says will someday be able to serve as factory workers, babysitters, crime stoppers and surgeons.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/tesla-tsla-q4-2025-vehicle-deliveries.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/tesla-tsla-q4-2025-vehicle-deliveries.html)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q1ziog/tesla_reports_418227_deliveries_for_the_fourth/", "score": 1714, "num_comments": 319, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author": "Puginator", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q1ziog/tesla_reports_418227_deliveries_for_the_fourth/", "flair": null, "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564210}

Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes. A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary (yes even at that time). I found his aspirations of self driving, AI , robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape. I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk. I remember talking to my father in law about it. “What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia?”  Too many eggs in one basket was his response. I ended  up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia. As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could. $200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares. \n\nIt has been a great ride since then.

Energy security and strategic materials are becoming matters of national policy, and when that happens, pricing, capital flows, and valuations change structurally.\n\nThat’s why I’m concentrated in uranium and rare earth companies that sit outside China and inside Western-aligned supply chains.\n\nMy core holdings are Energy Fuels (UUUU), Cameco (CCJ), Centrus Energy (LEU), MP Materials (MP), and Lynas (LYSDY). $300k USD invested.\n\nI chose these US/US allied companies because they represent critical choke points in supply chains that the United States and the West utilities cannot easily replace. Together, they cover uranium mining, nuclear fuel conversion and enrichment, and rare earth production and processing outside of China. China controls the majority of these rare earths and, following Venezeula, supply restrictions are only going to get worse. We’re in the hoarding era….\n\nThe recent events in Venezuela are mostly being discussed as an oil story, but I think that framing misses the larger signal. Whether oil supply increases or not is secondary. The more important takeaway is geopolitical: the United States has shown it is willing to act decisively when strategic interests are involved. That reinforces a world where energy, materials, and supply chains are increasingly treated as matters of security rather than free-market commodities.\n\nImportantly, Venezuela does not pose an oversupply risk to uranium or rare earths. These markets are nothing like oil. Uranium is heavily regulated and sold primarily through long-term contracts with utilities that plan fuel needs years in advance. Rare earths require not just mining, but complex processing infrastructure that takes a decade or more to develop. There is no mechanism for sudden supply flooding in either market.\n\nHistory supports this view. During the 2006–2007 uranium bull run, prices did not rise because of speculative demand alone. They rose because utilities realized they were under-contracted in a tightening market and rushed to secure long-term supply. Once utilities began competing for material, prices moved violently and quickly, and equities re-rated far beyond what traditional valuation models anticipated. Rare earths experienced a similar dynamic a few years later when export controls and geopolitical tension exposed how fragile global supply really was. I expect a very similar situation to take place between 2026-2028. After Venezuela, the last thing China will do is flood the market with their supply leading to a supply constraint that will enable rare earths and uranium to Sky-rocket. Just look at how commodities reacted yesterday…\n\nThose episodes weren’t driven by economic growth cycles — they were driven by procurement crises. When utilities and governments fear supply disruption, they don’t negotiate for the best price; they secure supply at almost any price.\n\nThat historical lesson matters today. Nuclear power is expanding globally, enrichment capacity is constrained, and non-China rare earth supply remains limited. At the same time, geopolitical risk is rising, not falling. If tensions escalate further — particularly around Taiwan — the immediate market reaction would likely be risk-off across all assets. But the second-order effect would be a rapid acceleration of industrial policy, subsidies, and long-term contracts favoring Western-aligned suppliers of uranium and strategic materials.\n\nI’m not positioned for a short-term commodity spike. I’m positioned for a world where governments and utilities prioritize certainty of supply over cost, just as they did in prior cycles. In those environments, uranium and rare earth equities don’t behave like normal commodities — they behave like strategic infrastructure.\n\nThat’s the bet.\n\nTLDR: Geopolitical fragmentation turns uranium and rare earths into strategic assets; history shows these markets don’t reprice gradually - they reprice violently when supply security is questioned.\n\nEdit: TRUMP on LIVE NATIONAL TELEVISION JUST ANNOUNCED THEY ARE RUNNING THE COUNTRY.

Here are the Best Takes and stocks", "selftext": "We’ve all read the news, but what are Trumps real motivations. What do you guys think he wants?\n\n1. Flooding the global oil supply will lower prices, or more importantly, give Trump additional control over  the global economy through the oil supply. This may potentially be used as a bargaining chip (e.g. to weaken Iranian, Russian, Chinese economies, or to strengthen the dollar through Tariff style manipulation and leverage). Funds like USO and UCO will be interesting to watch - personally i’m staying away. \n\n2. Not only does Venezuela hold oil, but it also holds lots of gold. While Gold is currently trading at all time highs (and many economies like BRICS have been stocking up on reserves), Trump may wish to crash the gold price to ‘reinforce’ the safety of the dollar. Or, again, he may wish to leverage control. I am holding IAUM, but may sell some to resize. Again interesting to watch. \n\n3. Some have also speculated a digital currency backed by tangible (potentially Venezuelan) assets - I don’t really buy this but its interesting nonetheless.\n\n4. US grid capacity shortages have been noticeable and heavy generators are already being rolled out to fuel Data Centres and AI Infrastructure. As mentioned by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, ‘massive fleets of diesel and gas’ generators (35GW massive) may help to bridge the gap until renewable energy / grid upgrades materialise. It would cost a huge amount to buy that much fuel, if only I could get it for free… I think CAT is a miss for other reasons, but GNRC and CMI might be good plays given this background. \n\n5. All of this can be very damaging to China, as well as the fact that China has been ‘renting’ Venezuelan resources through loans granting them rights to gold, oil and rare earth materials. While I don’t think that the Rare Earths are particularly significant, snubbing China is still useful for Trump in terms of resources and ego. There may be a rise in the likes of USAR…\n\nPersonally I believe that the gold price and ETFs will start to plateau, and pending Trumps actions, maybe even fall.\n\nOil ETFs will probably remain fairly stable until Trump does something, although I believe that stocks such as HAL or CVX would be solid investments over the next two years.\n\nDid i miss anything?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q3cmyi/what_does_trump_really_want_with_venezuela_here/", "score": 965, "num_comments": 598, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "author": "ahlornjtvn139", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q3cmyi/what_does_trump_really_want_with_venezuela_here/", "flair": "Industry Discussion", "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564262}

There is also an embargo and sanctions that still have not been lifted yet and this prevents any full scale operation there from any company but once the contracts are giving from the US treasury it can only make these companies stock go up further. I am looking at Halliburton HAL and Schlumberger SLB as I think these will both be excellent plays and will not be affected by oil prices as they don’t sell oil. SLB is the “brains” of the operation, SLB has the technology to detect all of Venezuelas remaining oil field, especially the oil in the hard to reach places and SLB plans the extraction and maps everything. No company has the technology SLB does. Halliburton HAL will be sent to repair the existing pipelines and pump. HAL will fix everything and they already have existing infrastructure in Venezuela. They will also support Chevrons drilling. I believe HAL could be profitable to hold for the next 6 - 12 months and SLB could be a good hold for the next 6 - 18 months. With these two companies you avoid the volatility of oil prices and the oil market getting flooded and prices dropping.\n\nOne refinery in particular I am looking at it Valero VLO, they specialize in refining Venezuela heavy crude products, this could be a good long term play as profits will spike significantly long term.\n\nAnother one to watch could be ConocoPhillips COP as they were an oil company involved in Venezuela many years ago and their equipment and assets were seized under the Moduro regime and are owed $10 billion because of this by Venezuela so I believe they will definitely get restitution.

The expiration pulled some EV sales forward to the third quarter for Tesla and other automakers.\n\nEven before that, the start of 2025 was a struggle for Tesla.\n\nAfter spending heavily to propel Trump back to the White House, Musk spent the first quarter of the year leading the president’s DOGE initiative to slash the federal workforce.\n\nMusk also endorsed Germany’s extremist anti-immigrant party, AfD, and later supported British anti-Muslim and anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson. In recent weeks, Musk has called to abolish the European Union.\n\nPartly in response to Musk’s incendiary rhetoric, Tesla has faced an enduring consumer backlash in Europe and the U.S. The company hasn’t fully recovered despite introducing a new, more affordable version of its Model Y SUV in October.\n\nHowever, Tesla shares still rallied in the second half of the year, jumping 40% in the third quarter, reaching a fresh record in mid-December. Musk bought $1 billion worth of shares in September.\n\nShareholders approved a new $1 trillion pay plan for Musk in November that will give the CEO more shares and increased control over the company. The vote came after Musk threatened to potentially leave Tesla if the plan didn’t pass.\n\nCritics voiced concerns that the plan doesn’t require Musk to spend a minimum amount of time on his Tesla work, and that there are no limits on his political activity.\n\nWhile Tesla doesn’t break out deliveries geographically, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) showed that the company lost market share in the region in 2025.\n\nTesla’s European registrations fell 39% in the first 11 months of 2025, while Chinese rival BYD saw registrations rise 240% in Europe. Overall, battery electric vehicles were more widely embraced in Europe in 2025, amounting to around 16% of all new vehicles sold there.\n\nSome analysts project that sales of Tesla’s more affordable Model Y standard, which the company launched in October, will help the company regain ground in coming quarters.\n\nIn a note last week, analysts at Cannacord Genuity wrote that EV adoption “is rising quickly in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil, where robust consumer interest could create meaningful long-term upside for Tesla, even as it faces fierce rivalry from Chinese automakers.”\n\nBesides BYD, Tesla now faces competition from other Chinese EV makers including Xiaomi and Geely.\n\nBut Tesla is selling investors on Musk’s vision of the future, or what he calls “sustainable abundance,” more than EV sales. That vision includes robotaxis, which Musk has promised for years, and humanoid robots, which he says will someday be able to serve as factory workers, babysitters, crime stoppers and surgeons.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/tesla-tsla-q4-2025-vehicle-deliveries.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/tesla-tsla-q4-2025-vehicle-deliveries.html)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q1ziog/tesla_reports_418227_deliveries_for_the_fourth/", "score": 1717, "num_comments": 319, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author": "Puginator", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q1ziog/tesla_reports_418227_deliveries_for_the_fourth/", "flair": null, "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564262}

I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k. I remember buying Macys, Hecla Mining, and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better. I was over trading like a mad man. This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7$ per trade during those days. Just young and dumb not really making any money. Wasting company time so no harm no foul. \n\nIn the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k. Which was basically my life savings at that point in time. I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres (tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per)  During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia. Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes. A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary (yes even at that time). I found his aspirations of self driving, AI , robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape. I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk. I remember talking to my father in law about it. “What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia?”  Too many eggs in one basket was his response. I ended  up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia. As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could. $200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares. \n\nIt has been a great ride since then. There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares. It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel\n\nto hold this long. So much bullshit -Crypto winter , Andrew Left short selling attacks, Covid selloffs, deepseek bullshit and most recently liberation day.

Energy security and strategic materials are becoming matters of national policy, and when that happens, pricing, capital flows, and valuations change structurally.\n\nThat’s why I’m concentrated in uranium and rare earth companies that sit outside China and inside Western-aligned supply chains.\n\nMy core holdings are Energy Fuels (UUUU), Cameco (CCJ), Centrus Energy (LEU), MP Materials (MP), and Lynas (LYSDY). $300k USD invested.\n\nI chose these US/US allied companies because they represent critical choke points in supply chains that the United States and the West utilities cannot easily replace. Together, they cover uranium mining, nuclear fuel conversion and enrichment, and rare earth production and processing outside of China. China controls the majority of these rare earths and, following Venezeula, supply restrictions are only going to get worse. We’re in the hoarding era….\n\nThe recent events in Venezuela are mostly being discussed as an oil story, but I think that framing misses the larger signal. Whether oil supply increases or not is secondary. The more important takeaway is geopolitical: the United States has shown it is willing to act decisively when strategic interests are involved. That reinforces a world where energy, materials, and supply chains are increasingly treated as matters of security rather than free-market commodities.\n\nImportantly, Venezuela does not pose an oversupply risk to uranium or rare earths. These markets are nothing like oil. Uranium is heavily regulated and sold primarily through long-term contracts with utilities that plan fuel needs years in advance. Rare earths require not just mining, but complex processing infrastructure that takes a decade or more to develop. There is no mechanism for sudden supply flooding in either market.\n\nHistory supports this view. During the 2006–2007 uranium bull run, prices did not rise because of speculative demand alone. They rose because utilities realized they were under-contracted in a tightening market and rushed to secure long-term supply. Once utilities began competing for material, prices moved violently and quickly, and equities re-rated far beyond what traditional valuation models anticipated. Rare earths experienced a similar dynamic a few years later when export controls and geopolitical tension exposed how fragile global supply really was. I expect a very similar situation to take place between 2026-2028. After Venezuela, the last thing China will do is flood the market with their supply leading to a supply constraint that will enable rare earths and uranium to Sky-rocket. Just look at how commodities reacted yesterday…\n\nThose episodes weren’t driven by economic growth cycles — they were driven by procurement crises. When utilities and governments fear supply disruption, they don’t negotiate for the best price; they secure supply at almost any price.\n\nThat historical lesson matters today. Nuclear power is expanding globally, enrichment capacity is constrained, and non-China rare earth supply remains limited. At the same time, geopolitical risk is rising, not falling. If tensions escalate further — particularly around Taiwan — the immediate market reaction would likely be risk-off across all assets. But the second-order effect would be a rapid acceleration of industrial policy, subsidies, and long-term contracts favoring Western-aligned suppliers of uranium and strategic materials.\n\nI’m not positioned for a short-term commodity spike. I’m positioned for a world where governments and utilities prioritize certainty of supply over cost, just as they did in prior cycles. In those environments, uranium and rare earth equities don’t behave like normal commodities — they behave like strategic infrastructure.\n\nThat’s the bet.\n\nTLDR: Geopolitical fragmentation turns uranium and rare earths into strategic assets; history shows these markets don’t reprice gradually - they reprice violently when supply security is questioned.\n\nEdit: TRUMP on LIVE NATIONAL TELEVISION JUST ANNOUNCED THEY ARE RUNNING THE COUNTRY.

But some 14 years later, BYD beat the American EV pioneer at its own game.\n\n>The Chinese car giant has overtaken Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs, according to 2025 data released by the two rivals this week.\n\n>BYD announced Thursday that it had sold 2.26 million EVs, up nearly 28% from 2024. Meanwhile, Tesla reported Friday a second straight year of declining sales: Deliveries fell 8.6% to only 1.6 million, recording the biggest annual drop in the company’s history.\n\n>BYD was able to overtake Tesla even though its EVs are not available for purchase in America, while China is Tesla’s second-largest market.\n\n>In the fourth quarter, Tesla’s sales came in at about 418,000, down 15.6% from a year earlier and an even sharper decline from record global sales in the third quarter, when American motorists were rushing to buy EVs before a $7,500 tax credit expired on October 1.\n\n>Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not report its sales by market, providing only global figures, but the US market is responsible for nearly half its revenue, according to company reports. Reports by other automakers Monday are also likely to show weak US EV sales in the final three months of 2025.\n\n>Tesla’s deliveries had grown nearly 50% a year at one point. But it reported its first drop in annual sales in 2024, posting a modest 1% decline. Its sales fell sharply in the first six months of 2025 as it faced more competition from the EV offerings of other automakers, such a BYD and legacy global automakers, as well as backlash against Musk’s political activities, which angered many potential American and European buyers.\n\n>Early in the year, when Musk was leading the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, there were regular protests outside Tesla showrooms in Europe and the United States, and some reports of vandalism against Tesla cars and sites.\n\n>The rush to take advantage of the soon-to-expire tax credit helped sales in the third quarter. But it likely brought forward purchases by some buyers who might have bought Teslas later in the year.\n\n>To try to counter the loss of the tax credit, Tesla rolled out cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars, but those versions, while costing about $5,000 less than their “premium” equivalents, also won’t travel as far on a full charge as the premium versions and lack some features.\n\n>Aggressive competition\n\n>BYD achieved the latest milestone while grappling with fierce competition and relentless price wars in its home market. The intense \\_\\_ in China has prompted the Shenzhen-based company to expand further overseas, though its low-price strategy has drawn scrutiny and led to new tariffs in some markets.\n\n>Growth in BYD’s overall sales, including EVs and hybrids, slowed to its weakest pace in five years, with more than 4.6 million vehicles sold last year – underscoring the company’s struggles in China, the world’s largest automobile market and where BYD sells the bulk of its cars.\n\n>BYD also reported profit declines for both the second and third quarters of 2025.\n\n>While China’s auto market has become less crowded in the past few years, competition remains stiff with around 150 car brands and more than 50 EV makers, according to HSBC’s research. Rivals like Geely, China’s second-largest EV maker, fast-rising competitor Leapmotor and latecomer Xiaomi, which debuted its first EV only in 2024, have gradually eroded BYD’s domestic market share.\n\n>From a peak of 35% in 2023, BYD’s market share fell to 29% in the first 11 months of 2025, according to China Passenger Car Association. In the same period last year, its sales declined more than 5%, while Geely’s surged nearly 90%.\n\n>Wang Chuanfu, BYD’s founder and CEO, attributed the slowdown in domestic sales to erosion of BYD’s technological lead and insufficient product differentiation at a December investor meeting, according to state-run media. But he added that the company would soon unveil new technologies.\n\n>Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rose 1.2% in early trading Friday. Shares closed 2025 up 18.6% for the year, as investors looked past weak sales and focused on Musk’s plans for a fleet of robotaxis and an “army” of humanoid robots that he has promised to start building soon. But so far the rollout of Tesla’s robotaxi service has fallen well short of his promises, limited to two metropolitan areas, Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, rather than serving half of the US population as he had predicted it would by the year’s end\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y9xd397b25bg1.png?width=1580&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e3cba444c0ce8fa4be24f01140bb8a45c69e8ca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3uxgersb25bg1.png?width=1589&format=png&auto=webp&s=81685925ef7f3f9b41e4afa85918d298f43d1d7e\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1q2uyeg/byd_5_after_becoming_worlds_top_ev_seller_with/", "score": 260, "num_comments": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author": "callsonreddit", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1q2uyeg/byd_5_after_becoming_worlds_top_ev_seller_with/", "flair": "News", "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564469}

I then sat for 10 minutes waiting for a DD miracle but nothing happened...\n\nThe problem? Vyvanse is a prodrug and so snorting it won't speed up its effects. You see the Lisdexamphetamine is dextroamphetamine with an attached L-lysine (amino acid) that breaks off in your body using enzymes... thus creating this slow-release mechanism.\n\nI wasn't discouraged and so I took short acting expired Ritalin, crushed it into about 120mg worth of powder and used the same delivery process to give me \"the edge\".\n\n[The delivery process](https://i.redd.it/guhgylvldyag1.gif)\n\nI instantly got hit with \"Writers euphoria\", some people say they see colors, all I saw was a pump'n'dump right in front of my eyes reaching the top of its pump. Perfectly timed using behavioral psychology to create strong FOMO to anyone waiting for their next hit of market open.\n\n**If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm talking about SLS.**\n\nI will attack this pump'n'dump scheme from several different views and maybe some of you will join me on this **'short'** trip.\n\n# Buckle up buckeroos, we're gonna start with fundamentals\n\nCurrently this shitco is trading at a share price giving it a mkt. cap close to USD 600M. First thing that I ask is who is the customer?\n\nIt's a bunch of unlucky people who basically have at most 1-2 years to live with a somewhat uncommon form of cancer: Acute Myleoid Leukemia. If we look at how many people get it globally we're gonna arrive at roughly:\n\n1.5-2.0 persons / 100.000\n\nNow let's look at all cancers (this will be important):\n\n± 200 people / 100.000\n\n**.... HOLY FUCK THE VYVANSE IS KICKING IN.**\n\n( What I didn't realize was that the Vyvanse has still entered my bloodstream and started dislodging the dextroamphetamine into my bloodstream, I have now trasncended into a dopamine and neuroephidephrine fueled state of being.)\n\n\\-----  \nWhy am I mentioning all cancers? Well it's to disrupt the one thing that is being spread through all the pump'n'dump posts: That this is a replacement for **Keytruda** (which was sitting at 25B revenue with 80% gross margins). But here's the first misconception that is being omitted in all the SLS cult posts:\n\nKeytruda is all-purpose, while the shit that SLS is producing **is NOT**. You need to be tested for the presence of WT-1 antigen which is only done for blood disorders/cancers. You may find the presence elsewhere but it says absolutely nothing about it being usable for this (source: I know a few doctors).\n\nThis means that while Keytruda might target the 200 people out of 100... SLS drugs will barely target 1% of that.  Why do I say barely? Well because that these drugs are given to specific people... CDK-9 is effective only for people with a certain (less common) mutation and GPS is given (to my understanding) to people in remission.\n\nSo let's do simple math (before I make you even more depressed):\n\nUSD 25B ---> 1% ---> 250M (let's be optimistic and say that 80% are eligible) --> 200M\n\nBut wait it gets better... however right now my heart is pumping, pupils are needle-point sized and I need to lower the adrenaline in my bloodstream by doing the only sensible thing I learnt from Elon Musk... **low doses of ketamine.**\n\n[Unlocking my full potential](https://i.redd.it/apm2dh6tdyag1.gif)\n\nKeytruda gets administered constantly, unlike GPS which is like <20 injections. So that 200M you were looking at? Yea it's probably way lower.\n\nNow that we've got over the \"HOLY SHIT THIS THING IS WORTH BILLIONS\" let's focus on the flying ponies in front of my eyes warning me about the financials and the CEO's marketing/dilution pattern.\n\n# A Good Modern CEO is always Professional Bullshitter.\n\nIf you've ever worked as a Software Engineer you will always notice two flavors of your average SWE.\n\n1. The technical guy who actually knows shit\n2. The bullshitter who's liked, but does shit and yaps whole day\n\nThe first one if he's career driven will become a good CTO. The second one will become CEO.\n\nThis is true for every profession, reality is that CEO needs to be able to sell, especially bullshit, to keep investors happy and to bring them exit liquidity. It's all a zero-sum game. Nobody wins, especially not the poor cancer patients who are used for advertising just like white-monkeys are in China.\n\nThe CEO SLS is no different to other CEOs except that this guy is a master bullshitter. How do you become a master bullshitter? Ambiguity. Think of the (1) technical guy, he will always be precise in his formulations, because he knows what he's talking about. the (2) bullshitter will always be ambiguous because he wants to sound smart.\n\nThe CEO has a beautiful pattern of selling very ambiguous news, carefully wording them in a way that the SLS cult members (read bagholders and MLM leaders) parrot the \"actual\" but not-factual message to the masses. Just look up the recent posts on bagholder/p'n'd subreddits for SLS. It's all bullshit purposefully pushed by bots and marketing team.\n\nAfter the share price jumps high, the CEO cuts a financing deal that basically tanks the price into oblivion, not including the perpetual warrant inducement plan (which alone makes acquisition very unlikely).\n\nThe best part? The CEO gets paid heftily even though close to 50% shareholders want to lower his above-standard pay. And there's a good reason he's getting such high cash bonuses - he knows it's all bullshit.\n\nAll of this will mean that if this company gets acquired (which is unlikely) it will be sold at a discount and not a premium. Notice the pattern that even after so many dilutions the market drives the price close to $4 a share... with constantly increasing share count it's amplifying the speed at which the company's valuation grows even though they still haven't really presented anything substantial.\n\n# Let's Look at the Recent Catalyst\n\nSo what spiked the current share price above $4? Results of the REGAL study were postponed, which was seen negatively and so the CEO wrote a very ambiguous post saying something on the lines of:\n\n\"We're still waiting for more deaths so that we can conclude the study.\" Which is absolutely hilarious. Because it doesn't say anything about SLS specifically, yet people interpret it in a way that it does and that the SLS specific treatment is actually the good one (it may be, but given the pattern I doubt it will be statistically significant)\n\nThe study includes both BAT (best available treatment) and the SLS drugs. The deaths they are waiting for might well be the BAT ones, while the SLS patients have already died (grim I know). Their argument: Average BAT life expectancy is 8 months or whatever they're saying.\n\nSo why do people think it's \"good news\" for SLS? Because people think they understand statistics when they actually don't. Heck I studied it, specialized in it as a mathematician... and even I will never dare to say that I fully understand statistics. Reality is that the delay might be negative, neutral or positive.  \n**WHY?:**\n\n* Many factors come into patient selection - The study isn't the typical \"let's pick 130 people at day 1 and start our tests\" they come in different cohorts/groups\n* You have high odds of selecting the \"good group\" that could even survive 5 years with bad treatment (this can be 10-15%)\n* All the bull posts you see focus on using the average as proof that this study is going on longer than it should (which is a very misleading statistic, and using it like this is pure bullshit for gullible people)... Average needs to be understood in a way that you will have people who died after 3 months and people who lived those 5 years -> and that will average out, so just looking at number of occurred deaths is not enough to know if there is a statistical significance. Saying that the study is going longer than expected is absolute bullshit, because if you have the healthier group by accident they will survive longer, but it will also be reflected in the final statistical analysis.\n* A small sample size like this is prone to distortions, follow up studies will be needed to know if this really works or not, which btw will definitely lead to more cash burn.\n\n**But most importantly:**\n\n* BAT for AML has significantly improved... and by significantly I mean really significantly. The 8 month figure is somewhat outdated by now as it might be closer to 10-12 months. Increasing the actual statistical significance needed to be observed with GPS.\n\n# Unsustainable Cash Burn and More to Come\n\nThe cash burn of this company is insane and even if they succeed with their tests they will face even higher cash burn due to the necessary shit they need to do to get this drug approved and into production. Given their current free cash, it's more than likely that they will need to raise more money.\n\n# So Why Are You Bearish?\n\nWell I like to think of it in terms of probability / uncertainty, specifically conditional probability. (Let's denote P(event | A ) as Probability of Event conditioned by A happening) Asks yourself this, which probability is higher?:\n\n(1) P( Good News | CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad )  \n(2) P( Bad News | CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad )\n\nWhich is more likely to be true? (1) > (2) or (1) < (2)?\n\nI'm gonna go with the likelihood of bad news as probable... This doesn't mean that the drug won't work, I just am certain that they will have to raise cash no matter what and the valuation once actual funds take a look at the revenue projections won't be as high as the current valuation.\n\nThe fact that the Trump Admin is pushing for cheaper drugs, is also pretty negative for any biotech trying to get their life-saving medication out there... This isn't the \"age of biotech\" (un)fortunately.\n\nHence I'm buying puts.\n\n**NOTE:** I'm not a biochemist, I might be wrong and I'm betting only money that I'm willing to lose, so don't follow blindly, do your own DD. Also brace for this post being downvoted by the SLS gang and Indian bots.

Excuse the language on the broker, I'm just a gambling addict from Turkey. I bought 3 call contracts on Micron that were 7 months out till expiration right before earnings and I happened to be correct about the company's performance. Not exactly an earnings play, I was actually planning to hold these longer, but especially after Micron's huge gains today, I couldn't help but want to secure my profits first before thinking about what to do next. I'm currently thinking maybe I'll buy ATM call options 6 months out on WDC, which is another company in a similar situation as Micron anyways tbh, and then hodl those for the next 3 months and see where this goes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1q2936h/micron_mu_gains/", "score": 35, "num_comments": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "author": "tugrulthelol", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1q2936h/micron_mu_gains/", "flair": "Gain", "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564469}

When cheap Venezuelan heavy oil enters the market, the input costs for complex refiners like **Valero** or **Marathon Petroleum** drop drastically. Since they sell their finished fuel at global market prices, their margins expand even if the overall price of oil is falling.\n\nLogistics: \n\nThe shift in tanker routes would be dramatic and rapid. Currently, Venezuelan oil moves on ghost tankers to Asia via secretive ship-to-ship transfers to bypass sanctions. A political shift would redirect this flow back to its natural market in the United States. Instead of a forty-day journey to China, the oil would only take four days to reach refineries in Houston or Lake Charles.

The expiration pulled some EV sales forward to the third quarter for Tesla and other automakers.\n\nEven before that, the start of 2025 was a struggle for Tesla.\n\nAfter spending heavily to propel Trump back to the White House, Musk spent the first quarter of the year leading the president’s DOGE initiative to slash the federal workforce.\n\nMusk also endorsed Germany’s extremist anti-immigrant party, AfD, and later supported British anti-Muslim and anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson. In recent weeks, Musk has called to abolish the European Union.\n\nPartly in response to Musk’s incendiary rhetoric, Tesla has faced an enduring consumer backlash in Europe and the U.S. The company hasn’t fully recovered despite introducing a new, more affordable version of its Model Y SUV in October.\n\nHowever, Tesla shares still rallied in the second half of the year, jumping 40% in the third quarter, reaching a fresh record in mid-December. Musk bought $1 billion worth of shares in September.\n\nShareholders approved a new $1 trillion pay plan for Musk in November that will give the CEO more shares and increased control over the company. The vote came after Musk threatened to potentially leave Tesla if the plan didn’t pass.\n\nCritics voiced concerns that the plan doesn’t require Musk to spend a minimum amount of time on his Tesla work, and that there are no limits on his political activity.\n\nWhile Tesla doesn’t break out deliveries geographically, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) showed that the company lost market share in the region in 2025.\n\nTesla’s European registrations fell 39% in the first 11 months of 2025, while Chinese rival BYD saw registrations rise 240% in Europe. Overall, battery electric vehicles were more widely embraced in Europe in 2025, amounting to around 16% of all new vehicles sold there.\n\nSome analysts project that sales of Tesla’s more affordable Model Y standard, which the company launched in October, will help the company regain ground in coming quarters.\n\nIn a note last week, analysts at Cannacord Genuity wrote that EV adoption “is rising quickly in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil, where robust consumer interest could create meaningful long-term upside for Tesla, even as it faces fierce rivalry from Chinese automakers.”\n\nBesides BYD, Tesla now faces competition from other Chinese EV makers including Xiaomi and Geely.\n\nBut Tesla is selling investors on Musk’s vision of the future, or what he calls “sustainable abundance,” more than EV sales. That vision includes robotaxis, which Musk has promised for years, and humanoid robots, which he says will someday be able to serve as factory workers, babysitters, crime stoppers and surgeons.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/tesla-tsla-q4-2025-vehicle-deliveries.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/tesla-tsla-q4-2025-vehicle-deliveries.html)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q1ziog/tesla_reports_418227_deliveries_for_the_fourth/", "score": 1713, "num_comments": 319, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author": "Puginator", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q1ziog/tesla_reports_418227_deliveries_for_the_fourth/", "flair": null, "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564469}

Why Musk’s venture could be biggest IPO ever", "selftext": "As billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk readies to take SpaceX to the public market, investors are awaiting the chance to get in on what is expected to be the biggest IPO on record.\n\n Musk said late last month that reports of the space technology company’s plans to go public this year were “accurate.” Multiple outlets reported that the IPO was in the works following a share sale valuing the firm at around $800 billion.\n\n SpaceX is reportedly looking at a value of around $1.5 trillion when it hits the public market. That would surpass the prior record set by the Saudi Aramco IPO in 2019.\n\nWall Street heavy hitters have already begun throwing their weight behind SpaceX as private investors. Baron Capital’s Ron Baron said around a quarter of his personal investments are in the company. On top of that, SpaceX is one of the largest positions in the Baron Partners Fund. It’s also the biggest holding in the ARK’s Venture Fund run by Cathie Wood.\n\nSpaceX has shown leadership in the low-earth orbit, or LEO, market, according to Jefferies. SpaceX saw a quarterly record for LEO launches at 971 in the final three months of the year, an increase of more than 30% from the prior quarter and about 70% from a year ago, the bank found. The company launched more than 3,200 satellites in 2025, a new yearly record and increase of more than 60% from the prior year.\n\nAnalyst Kevin Lin told clients that SpaceX’s launch volume is “accelerating,” while competitor Amazon. Leo is “lagging” despite entering a stable launch phase. Amazon said in November that businesses could test out its rebranded Leo product as it aimed to make up ground against Musk’s Starlink.\n\nLin said he expects the total number of launches from across companies to hit all-time highs in the near future. SpaceX’s outlook is bright for another reason: data centers. Technology moguls looking for ways to build out infrastructure to support the artificial intelligence boom are increasingly looking to firms like SpaceX that could put data centers in space, Lin said. Space data centers are expected to “drive” the total addressable market for the LEO sector, the analyst added. \n\n“In response to the surge in demand for AI computing power and the Earth’s energy bottleneck, the topic of space data centers has gained momentum,” Lin told clients. \n\nTo be sure, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said there are key problems that need to be worked out in order to effectively put data centers in space. However, Yu said he’s “encouraged” by seeing companies such as Google and OpenAI also looking at how to do this. “There are clearly technical challenges to making this a viable endeavor but these seem to be engineering constraints as opposed to physics,” Yu wrote to clients in a note last month. \n\nA bumper SpaceX IPO could further drive up the wealth for Musk. His controversial $1 trillion pay package from his electric vehicle company Tesla was approved by shareholders late last year.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q2azqr/pro_analysis_spacex_stock_debut_is_the_big_market/", "score": 40, "num_comments": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "author": "Guy_PCS", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q2azqr/pro_analysis_spacex_stock_debut_is_the_big_market/", "flair": "Company Discussion", "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564469}

Prices are high, tech runs the show, and everyone’s talking about AI. But the reality today is very different than 2000, especially when you look under the hood.\n\nBack in the dot com bubble, a huge chunk of companies had no profits at all. A lot of them didn’t even have real products. They were valued based on clicks, website traffic, or just the idea that “the internet is the future.” When money got tighter, those companies had nothing to fall back on. They ran out of cash and went to zero.\n\nToday’s NASDAQ is led by companies that actually make insane amounts of money. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, Meta, Amazon. These aren’t hype machines. They generate real profits every single quarter. Some of them make more cash in a year than entire industries did back then.\n\nAnother big difference is how important tech is now. In 2000, tech was optional. Today it’s infrastructure. Cloud services, chips, software, and data centers run basically everything. Governments, hospitals, banks, and the military all depend on this stuff. That demand doesn’t disappear just because the economy slows down.\n\nThat doesn’t mean stocks can’t drop. They absolutely can. High prices usually mean lower returns and more volatility. But a drop today would likely be about valuations coming down, not companies blowing up.\n\nThe dot com crash was about fake businesses failing. Today’s market is about real businesses being priced aggressively. That’s a big difference that gets lost in the headlines.\n\nNot saying buy or sell.

Gold has a certain pattern respecting the top uptrend line resistance, technically we can say from this point of view that it should how ever not 100% should go down and the same downtrend pattern for OIL([screenshot ](https://www.tradingview.com/x/5u9pTPaV/)\\#2)... but it would need a catalyst for the prices to truly go down further... if we see the entire economic outlook, wars, inflation etc... there is no catalyst...not until now... and let me give you some evidence. First of all of the PREMISE(or i should say the promise)... USA wants and needs to cut inflation and debt for that they need to lower rates(there is tons of youtube videos of trump talking about lowering inflation and energy cost) if they lower rates yes we would probably get a nice stock bull run market... BUT and here is my point for how long?\n\nEvidence number 1: WARREN BUFFET (The greed)\n\n[https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/models/buffett-indicator.php](https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/models/buffett-indicator.php)\n\nWe are on overvaluated and highly greedy market, naturally markets needs to correct, yes for the new ones markets actually can correct 30% or more... its pure cycles and statistics.\n\nEvidence number 2: GOLD and OIL are the number one money wise backing up economic reserves... as the more people and countries accumulate prices go up because accumulation is also shortages and also consumption(chips, rockets..,etc).\n\nEvidence number 3: Venezuela is the world largest Oil reserve deposit but how much does the actual refinieries extract and export? Almost nothing(as seen in [scrshot ](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INTERACTIVE-Crude-oil-reserves-vs-exports-1756989578.png?quality=80)\\#4) because it is under cartel or regime occupation.\n\nEvidence number 4: Venezuela is the second to third world largest GOLD(unmined) deposit(8900 tons)... now this is where things get a little tricky because not only this info is backedup by venezuela government but also U.S government and this is where next evidence comes in...\n\nEvidence number 5: U.S.A government and military intervention. They have been foresighting this scenario of control for some years now let me give you the source (keyword search: \"8,900\"):\n\n[https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-116shrg40426/html/CHRG-116shrg40426.htm](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-116shrg40426/html/CHRG-116shrg40426.htm)\n\nNow what do i think with this data will happen in the future well now i see 2 possible scenarios to occur, yes they are a bit speculation, but seen the wide angle and data presented for me it makes sense at least.\n\nScenario 1: U.S.A gets controlled of their refineries and start mining and extracting oil and making deals ASAP, since this is new matter entering our economic space will create more supply eventualy causing the prices of everything to fall, energy, goods and services, some stocks might explode because of rates lowering.\n\nScenario 2: China moves to Taiwan and changes government as eficient as USA militarily in Venezuela. Chips supply will fall, causing the U.S.A to prepare for the next Chips Recesion, either they'll need to move their photolitography out of the contry or rebuild it abroad... causing the economy of U.S.A to stagnate... AI develop will slowdown causing tech companies to correct... USA is preparing itself for china's next move thats why they need those refineries to start working thats how they will balance their economy as prices go down, they'll start acumulating more and more resources for the next A.I race between china and USA... A.I firsts Nuclear powered plants are set to be running by 2028-30 so they need to prepare for whats comming.\n\n>This is my bet puts on gold($3500), oil($40), and tech stock market NVIDIA($140)(only if china moves pieces) expiration date march 2027\n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q3e6jr/why_is_no_one_seeing_the_bigger_picture/", "score": 0, "num_comments": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.36, "author": "SpareMaize9237", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q3e6jr/why_is_no_one_seeing_the_bigger_picture/", "flair": "Broad market news", "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564469}

I find this personally to be anywhere upwards of 3 years. With these in mind I found Quantumscape towards the end of 2021 midway through its intial covid money hype run\n\nFor some history we have been using very similar to sony's commercialized 1991 lithium ion battery for the last 34 years, we have done a million minor changes to optimize the energy density, cycle count, safety and discharge rate but at this point we are maxed out in what it can do for us\n\nQuantumscape's moat while cliche being similar to TSMC/Nvidia partnership, through non stop learning and adapting to newer chemistries they have the next 10 years planned out to modernize the lithium battery and energy industry further than their intial 2028 consumer production battery without having to handle the actual production themselves. This should allow them to maintain their leadership role of at least 2 years. These improvements will come in the form of EVs, ebikes, stationary storage either grid or home, lighter phones and while not being enough for large passenger aircraft they should aid the EVtol and drone markets\n\nTheir technology of a ceramic seperator that lacks imperfections on the nanoscale allows them to remove the anode from the battery and instead allows for lithium plating during the charging process without destructive dendrites from forming. Currently the anode's limitation to the amount of energy a battery can store in either Wh/L (watt hour per litre) or Wh/Kg. By being able to remove the anode liquid solution this opens the potential for even higher energy densities beyond NMC down the line.\n\nNow to get to why its a good thing as comsumers. The semi solid state battery Quantumscape plans to unveil will have 50% better energy density(range anxiety no more), be able to easily handle 800 charge/discharge cycles even at fast charging rates of 4C+ (10mins 10-80%) and after these 800cycles still be at 80% max capacity, be adaptable to temperature changes that currently reduce lithium ion battery's winter capacity by 30-50%(at -15 to -35Cº) all while being a lot more stable than the already pretty good batteries so even less risk of fire.\n\nAs value investors we see a lot of chaotic business management teams in the market. Another reason I like Quantumscape is their understanding of slow and steady, they have been chugging away at this mission for 15 years now under their CTO Standford's professor Dr Tim Holme. Coupled by their conservative understanding of market dynamics they have been able to raise money at times to keep themselves liquid through the last 3 years to ride out the market uncertainty without needing to pivot. At this point they sit on 1B cash and have partnerships with Murata and Corning so that they can focus on developing the technology and production output plans without having to handle production scaleout directly.

I know it's not a biotech with a $200M market cap and it's not rocketing, but I think it has potential, even if it's been slow lately.\n\nFirst of all, what does Meta do? We all know it for its social media (IG, Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads), which have an incredible 3.5 billion users daily. It's practically a monopoly, but officially it hasn't been deemed such, so we're safe.\n\nThey generate incredible cash flow and advertise themselves, but we'll see about that later. Furthermore, even if it seems like Meta has fallen behind in certain hot sectors, that's not the case. They've actually launched into AI development (Meta AI, the one integrated into their platforms, which may seem behind but has 1 billion downloads), AR, and VR with products like Meta Quest and the new Ray-Ban sunglasses.\n\nBut let's take a step back: how does Meta make money? How does it spend? Debt? Cash? Let's analyze the Q3 2025 balance sheet\n\nTotal revenue: $51.24 billion (+26% YoY)\nFamily of Apps (FB, IG, WA, Messenger): $50.8 billion (99% of total)\nAlmost all from advertising: $50.1 billion (+26% YoY)\nAd impressions +14%\nAverage price per ad +10%\nReality Labs (VR/AR/Quest/glasses): only $470 million (+74% YoY)\nWhat do we learn? It earns almost all its revenue from ads on social apps, which generates a constant cash flow.\n\nTotal expenses Q3: $30.71 billion (+32% YoY)\nMain items: salaries, infrastructure, legal, depreciation\nGuidance for full-year 2025 expenses: $116-118 billion (+22-24% YoY)\nCapex Q3: $19.37 billion\nGuidance for full-year 2025 Capex: $70-72 billion (huge for AI data centers, GPUs, infrastructure)\nWhere the big cash is going:\n\nAI infrastructure (data centers, compute)\nReality Labs losses: ~$4-5 billion per quarter\nBuybacks & Dividends\nThe company is spending heavily on future products that are still losing money.\n\nCash & marketable securities (September 30, 2025): $44.45 billion\nLong-term debt: $28.83 billion (stable, not pumping debt)\nNet cash: +$15.6 billion (cash > debt)\nQ3 free cash flow: $10.63 billion (positive despite crazy capex)\nI'd like to point out that last quarter's earnings were drastically reduced due to some occasional tax payments.\n\nIn my opinion, I see an opportunity here: despite being an already established company with a generous market cap of 1.64T, I believe it could still yield significant potential (we've seen the rise of even larger companies like Alphabet or Nvidia). While it's accumulating cash with minimal expenses through social media ads, which are now (fortunately or unfortunately) ingrained in our daily lives, it's investing mountains of money (which it earns regularly and without debt) in innovative sectors and products with significant growth potential, which could eventually dominate their industry.\n\nIt hasn't had incredible performances lately; compared to its sector peers, it performed much less strongly last year, even less than the SP500 (which could be an advantage; for once, we're not buying at the highs). It currently has a P/E ratio of 29, which isn't particularly low, but I urge you to look for something less overvalued in the current market, especially in the tech sector. If there were to be a retracement or even a bear market in 2026, as some claim, Meta should be less affected, being already closer to its fair value.\n\nSo, I'm thinking about it. Do you already have any shares or options? What do you think?\n\nObviously, this isn't financial advice; do your research before deciding.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q2vpni/meta_has_a_huge_potential/", "score": 0, "num_comments": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.41, "author": "Tothemoon373", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q2vpni/meta_has_a_huge_potential/", "flair": "Company Analysis", "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564469}

I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school. The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers. I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k. I remember buying Macys, Hecla Mining, and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better. I was over trading like a mad man. This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7$ per trade during those days. Just young and dumb not really making any money. Wasting company time so no harm no foul. \n\nIn the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k. Which was basically my life savings at that point in time. I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres (tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per)  During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia. Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes. A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary (yes even at that time). I found his aspirations of self driving, AI , robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape. I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk. I remember talking to my father in law about it. “What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia?”  Too many eggs in one basket was his response. I ended  up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia. As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could. $200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares. \n\nIt has been a great ride since then. There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares. It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel\n\nto hold this long. So much bullshit -Crypto winter , Andrew Left short selling attacks, Covid selloffs, deepseek bullshit and most recently liberation day.

But some 14 years later, BYD beat the American EV pioneer at its own game.\n\n>The Chinese car giant has overtaken Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs, according to 2025 data released by the two rivals this week.\n\n>BYD announced Thursday that it had sold 2.26 million EVs, up nearly 28% from 2024. Meanwhile, Tesla reported Friday a second straight year of declining sales: Deliveries fell 8.6% to only 1.6 million, recording the biggest annual drop in the company’s history.\n\n>BYD was able to overtake Tesla even though its EVs are not available for purchase in America, while China is Tesla’s second-largest market.\n\n>In the fourth quarter, Tesla’s sales came in at about 418,000, down 15.6% from a year earlier and an even sharper decline from record global sales in the third quarter, when American motorists were rushing to buy EVs before a $7,500 tax credit expired on October 1.\n\n>Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not report its sales by market, providing only global figures, but the US market is responsible for nearly half its revenue, according to company reports. Reports by other automakers Monday are also likely to show weak US EV sales in the final three months of 2025.\n\n>Tesla’s deliveries had grown nearly 50% a year at one point. But it reported its first drop in annual sales in 2024, posting a modest 1% decline. Its sales fell sharply in the first six months of 2025 as it faced more competition from the EV offerings of other automakers, such a BYD and legacy global automakers, as well as backlash against Musk’s political activities, which angered many potential American and European buyers.\n\n>Early in the year, when Musk was leading the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, there were regular protests outside Tesla showrooms in Europe and the United States, and some reports of vandalism against Tesla cars and sites.\n\n>The rush to take advantage of the soon-to-expire tax credit helped sales in the third quarter. But it likely brought forward purchases by some buyers who might have bought Teslas later in the year.\n\n>To try to counter the loss of the tax credit, Tesla rolled out cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars, but those versions, while costing about $5,000 less than their “premium” equivalents, also won’t travel as far on a full charge as the premium versions and lack some features.\n\n>Aggressive competition\n\n>BYD achieved the latest milestone while grappling with fierce competition and relentless price wars in its home market. The intense \\_\\_ in China has prompted the Shenzhen-based company to expand further overseas, though its low-price strategy has drawn scrutiny and led to new tariffs in some markets.\n\n>Growth in BYD’s overall sales, including EVs and hybrids, slowed to its weakest pace in five years, with more than 4.6 million vehicles sold last year – underscoring the company’s struggles in China, the world’s largest automobile market and where BYD sells the bulk of its cars.\n\n>BYD also reported profit declines for both the second and third quarters of 2025.\n\n>While China’s auto market has become less crowded in the past few years, competition remains stiff with around 150 car brands and more than 50 EV makers, according to HSBC’s research. Rivals like Geely, China’s second-largest EV maker, fast-rising competitor Leapmotor and latecomer Xiaomi, which debuted its first EV only in 2024, have gradually eroded BYD’s domestic market share.\n\n>From a peak of 35% in 2023, BYD’s market share fell to 29% in the first 11 months of 2025, according to China Passenger Car Association. In the same period last year, its sales declined more than 5%, while Geely’s surged nearly 90%.\n\n>Wang Chuanfu, BYD’s founder and CEO, attributed the slowdown in domestic sales to erosion of BYD’s technological lead and insufficient product differentiation at a December investor meeting, according to state-run media. But he added that the company would soon unveil new technologies.\n\n>Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rose 1.2% in early trading Friday. Shares closed 2025 up 18.6% for the year, as investors looked past weak sales and focused on Musk’s plans for a fleet of robotaxis and an “army” of humanoid robots that he has promised to start building soon. But so far the rollout of Tesla’s robotaxi service has fallen well short of his promises, limited to two metropolitan areas, Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, rather than serving half of the US population as he had predicted it would by the year’s end\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y9xd397b25bg1.png?width=1580&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e3cba444c0ce8fa4be24f01140bb8a45c69e8ca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3uxgersb25bg1.png?width=1589&format=png&auto=webp&s=81685925ef7f3f9b41e4afa85918d298f43d1d7e\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1q2uyeg/byd_5_after_becoming_worlds_top_ev_seller_with/", "score": 262, "num_comments": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author": "callsonreddit", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1q2uyeg/byd_5_after_becoming_worlds_top_ev_seller_with/", "flair": "News", "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564537}

I then sat for 10 minutes waiting for a DD miracle but nothing happened...\n\nThe problem? Vyvanse is a prodrug and so snorting it won't speed up its effects. You see the Lisdexamphetamine is dextroamphetamine with an attached L-lysine (amino acid) that breaks off in your body using enzymes... thus creating this slow-release mechanism.\n\nI wasn't discouraged and so I took short acting expired Ritalin, crushed it into about 120mg worth of powder and used the same delivery process to give me \"the edge\".\n\n[The delivery process](https://i.redd.it/guhgylvldyag1.gif)\n\nI instantly got hit with \"Writers euphoria\", some people say they see colors, all I saw was a pump'n'dump right in front of my eyes reaching the top of its pump. Perfectly timed using behavioral psychology to create strong FOMO to anyone waiting for their next hit of market open.\n\n**If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm talking about SLS.**\n\nI will attack this pump'n'dump scheme from several different views and maybe some of you will join me on this **'short'** trip.\n\n# Buckle up buckeroos, we're gonna start with fundamentals\n\nCurrently this shitco is trading at a share price giving it a mkt. cap close to USD 600M. First thing that I ask is who is the customer?\n\nIt's a bunch of unlucky people who basically have at most 1-2 years to live with a somewhat uncommon form of cancer: Acute Myleoid Leukemia. If we look at how many people get it globally we're gonna arrive at roughly:\n\n1.5-2.0 persons / 100.000\n\nNow let's look at all cancers (this will be important):\n\n± 200 people / 100.000\n\n**.... HOLY FUCK THE VYVANSE IS KICKING IN.**\n\n( What I didn't realize was that the Vyvanse has still entered my bloodstream and started dislodging the dextroamphetamine into my bloodstream, I have now trasncended into a dopamine and neuroephidephrine fueled state of being.)\n\n\\-----  \nWhy am I mentioning all cancers? Well it's to disrupt the one thing that is being spread through all the pump'n'dump posts: That this is a replacement for **Keytruda** (which was sitting at 25B revenue with 80% gross margins). But here's the first misconception that is being omitted in all the SLS cult posts:\n\nKeytruda is all-purpose, while the shit that SLS is producing **is NOT**. You need to be tested for the presence of WT-1 antigen which is only done for blood disorders/cancers. You may find the presence elsewhere but it says absolutely nothing about it being usable for this (source: I know a few doctors).\n\nThis means that while Keytruda might target the 200 people out of 100... SLS drugs will barely target 1% of that.  Why do I say barely? Well because that these drugs are given to specific people... CDK-9 is effective only for people with a certain (less common) mutation and GPS is given (to my understanding) to people in remission.\n\nSo let's do simple math (before I make you even more depressed):\n\nUSD 25B ---> 1% ---> 250M (let's be optimistic and say that 80% are eligible) --> 200M\n\nBut wait it gets better... however right now my heart is pumping, pupils are needle-point sized and I need to lower the adrenaline in my bloodstream by doing the only sensible thing I learnt from Elon Musk... **low doses of ketamine.**\n\n[Unlocking my full potential](https://i.redd.it/apm2dh6tdyag1.gif)\n\nKeytruda gets administered constantly, unlike GPS which is like <20 injections. So that 200M you were looking at? Yea it's probably way lower.\n\nNow that we've got over the \"HOLY SHIT THIS THING IS WORTH BILLIONS\" let's focus on the flying ponies in front of my eyes warning me about the financials and the CEO's marketing/dilution pattern.\n\n# A Good Modern CEO is always Professional Bullshitter.\n\nIf you've ever worked as a Software Engineer you will always notice two flavors of your average SWE.\n\n1. The technical guy who actually knows shit\n2. The bullshitter who's liked, but does shit and yaps whole day\n\nThe first one if he's career driven will become a good CTO. The second one will become CEO.\n\nThis is true for every profession, reality is that CEO needs to be able to sell, especially bullshit, to keep investors happy and to bring them exit liquidity. It's all a zero-sum game. Nobody wins, especially not the poor cancer patients who are used for advertising just like white-monkeys are in China.\n\nThe CEO SLS is no different to other CEOs except that this guy is a master bullshitter. How do you become a master bullshitter? Ambiguity. Think of the (1) technical guy, he will always be precise in his formulations, because he knows what he's talking about. the (2) bullshitter will always be ambiguous because he wants to sound smart.\n\nThe CEO has a beautiful pattern of selling very ambiguous news, carefully wording them in a way that the SLS cult members (read bagholders and MLM leaders) parrot the \"actual\" but not-factual message to the masses. Just look up the recent posts on bagholder/p'n'd subreddits for SLS. It's all bullshit purposefully pushed by bots and marketing team.\n\nAfter the share price jumps high, the CEO cuts a financing deal that basically tanks the price into oblivion, not including the perpetual warrant inducement plan (which alone makes acquisition very unlikely).\n\nThe best part? The CEO gets paid heftily even though close to 50% shareholders want to lower his above-standard pay. And there's a good reason he's getting such high cash bonuses - he knows it's all bullshit.\n\nAll of this will mean that if this company gets acquired (which is unlikely) it will be sold at a discount and not a premium. Notice the pattern that even after so many dilutions the market drives the price close to $4 a share... with constantly increasing share count it's amplifying the speed at which the company's valuation grows even though they still haven't really presented anything substantial.\n\n# Let's Look at the Recent Catalyst\n\nSo what spiked the current share price above $4? Results of the REGAL study were postponed, which was seen negatively and so the CEO wrote a very ambiguous post saying something on the lines of:\n\n\"We're still waiting for more deaths so that we can conclude the study.\" Which is absolutely hilarious. Because it doesn't say anything about SLS specifically, yet people interpret it in a way that it does and that the SLS specific treatment is actually the good one (it may be, but given the pattern I doubt it will be statistically significant)\n\nThe study includes both BAT (best available treatment) and the SLS drugs. The deaths they are waiting for might well be the BAT ones, while the SLS patients have already died (grim I know). Their argument: Average BAT life expectancy is 8 months or whatever they're saying.\n\nSo why do people think it's \"good news\" for SLS? Because people think they understand statistics when they actually don't. Heck I studied it, specialized in it as a mathematician... and even I will never dare to say that I fully understand statistics. Reality is that the delay might be negative, neutral or positive.  \n**WHY?:**\n\n* Many factors come into patient selection - The study isn't the typical \"let's pick 130 people at day 1 and start our tests\" they come in different cohorts/groups\n* You have high odds of selecting the \"good group\" that could even survive 5 years with bad treatment (this can be 10-15%)\n* All the bull posts you see focus on using the average as proof that this study is going on longer than it should (which is a very misleading statistic, and using it like this is pure bullshit for gullible people)... Average needs to be understood in a way that you will have people who died after 3 months and people who lived those 5 years -> and that will average out, so just looking at number of occurred deaths is not enough to know if there is a statistical significance. Saying that the study is going longer than expected is absolute bullshit, because if you have the healthier group by accident they will survive longer, but it will also be reflected in the final statistical analysis.\n* A small sample size like this is prone to distortions, follow up studies will be needed to know if this really works or not, which btw will definitely lead to more cash burn.\n\n**But most importantly:**\n\n* BAT for AML has significantly improved... and by significantly I mean really significantly. The 8 month figure is somewhat outdated by now as it might be closer to 10-12 months. Increasing the actual statistical significance needed to be observed with GPS.\n\n# Unsustainable Cash Burn and More to Come\n\nThe cash burn of this company is insane and even if they succeed with their tests they will face even higher cash burn due to the necessary shit they need to do to get this drug approved and into production. Given their current free cash, it's more than likely that they will need to raise more money.\n\n# So Why Are You Bearish?\n\nWell I like to think of it in terms of probability / uncertainty, specifically conditional probability. (Let's denote P(event | A ) as Probability of Event conditioned by A happening) Asks yourself this, which probability is higher?:\n\n(1) P( Good News | CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad )  \n(2) P( Bad News | CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad )\n\nWhich is more likely to be true? (1) > (2) or (1) < (2)?\n\nI'm gonna go with the likelihood of bad news as probable... This doesn't mean that the drug won't work, I just am certain that they will have to raise cash no matter what and the valuation once actual funds take a look at the revenue projections won't be as high as the current valuation.\n\nThe fact that the Trump Admin is pushing for cheaper drugs, is also pretty negative for any biotech trying to get their life-saving medication out there... This isn't the \"age of biotech\" (un)fortunately.\n\nHence I'm buying puts.\n\n**NOTE:** I'm not a biochemist, I might be wrong and I'm betting only money that I'm willing to lose, so don't follow blindly, do your own DD. Also brace for this post being downvoted by the SLS gang and Indian bots. One last thing... a big middle finger fuck you to anyone who is trying to profit by using dying people as advertisement.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xul15buwdyag1.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=292f3986d4e479518690dcee02953c68b4212c9d\n\n**My position is small, because I'm locked down in other trades, sharing mostly because I like to do equity research:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/86f0tiv8eyag1.jpg?width=549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=971f62f43ea2409f69d90f4b226e6efcc0e59418\n\nEDIT: To the existing and new bots out there, the SLS cult and other believers, yes I will double down if the stock price goes up:) Answering here since I received \"very nice\" DM requests.

Here are the Best Takes and stocks", "selftext": "We’ve all read the news, but what are Trumps real motivations. What do you guys think he wants?\n\n1. Flooding the global oil supply will lower prices, or more importantly, give Trump additional control over  the global economy through the oil supply. This may potentially be used as a bargaining chip (e.g. to weaken Iranian, Russian, Chinese economies, or to strengthen the dollar through Tariff style manipulation and leverage). Funds like USO and UCO will be interesting to watch - personally i’m staying away. \n\n2. Not only does Venezuela hold oil, but it also holds lots of gold. While Gold is currently trading at all time highs (and many economies like BRICS have been stocking up on reserves), Trump may wish to crash the gold price to ‘reinforce’ the safety of the dollar. Or, again, he may wish to leverage control. I am holding IAUM, but may sell some to resize. Again interesting to watch. \n\n3. Some have also speculated a digital currency backed by tangible (potentially Venezuelan) assets - I don’t really buy this but its interesting nonetheless.\n\n4. US grid capacity shortages have been noticeable and heavy generators are already being rolled out to fuel Data Centres and AI Infrastructure. As mentioned by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, ‘massive fleets of diesel and gas’ generators (35GW massive) may help to bridge the gap until renewable energy / grid upgrades materialise. It would cost a huge amount to buy that much fuel, if only I could get it for free… I think CAT is a miss for other reasons, but GNRC and CMI might be good plays given this background. \n\n5. All of this can be very damaging to China, as well as the fact that China has been ‘renting’ Venezuelan resources through loans granting them rights to gold, oil and rare earth materials. While I don’t think that the Rare Earths are particularly significant, snubbing China is still useful for Trump in terms of resources and ego. There may be a rise in the likes of USAR…\n\nPersonally I believe that the gold price and ETFs will start to plateau, and pending Trumps actions, maybe even fall.\n\nOil ETFs will probably remain fairly stable until Trump does something, although I believe that stocks such as HAL or CVX would be solid investments over the next two years.\n\nDid i miss anything?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q3cmyi/what_does_trump_really_want_with_venezuela_here/", "score": 964, "num_comments": 599, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "author": "ahlornjtvn139", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q3cmyi/what_does_trump_really_want_with_venezuela_here/", "flair": "Industry Discussion", "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564537}

Pipelines are 50 years old and leaking. It will take billions and years of work by companies like **Schlumberger** and **Halliburton** to get production back to 2 million barrels per day.  \n\nNow to the reffineries: \n\nThe real money in this scenario is made through the crack spread, which is the profit margin a refinery earns by turning raw crude into products like diesel and jet fuel. When cheap Venezuelan heavy oil enters the market, the input costs for complex refiners like **Valero** or **Marathon Petroleum** drop drastically. Since they sell their finished fuel at global market prices, their margins expand even if the overall price of oil is falling.\n\nLogistics: \n\nThe shift in tanker routes would be dramatic and rapid. Currently, Venezuelan oil moves on ghost tankers to Asia via secretive ship-to-ship transfers to bypass sanctions. A political shift would redirect this flow back to its natural market in the United States. Instead of a forty-day journey to China, the oil would only take four days to reach refineries in Houston or Lake Charles. (any suggestions?)\n\nFinally, you have to consider the impact on the US shale industry.

The expiration pulled some EV sales forward to the third quarter for Tesla and other automakers.\n\nEven before that, the start of 2025 was a struggle for Tesla.\n\nAfter spending heavily to propel Trump back to the White House, Musk spent the first quarter of the year leading the president’s DOGE initiative to slash the federal workforce.\n\nMusk also endorsed Germany’s extremist anti-immigrant party, AfD, and later supported British anti-Muslim and anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson. In recent weeks, Musk has called to abolish the European Union.\n\nPartly in response to Musk’s incendiary rhetoric, Tesla has faced an enduring consumer backlash in Europe and the U.S. The company hasn’t fully recovered despite introducing a new, more affordable version of its Model Y SUV in October.\n\nHowever, Tesla shares still rallied in the second half of the year, jumping 40% in the third quarter, reaching a fresh record in mid-December. Musk bought $1 billion worth of shares in September.\n\nShareholders approved a new $1 trillion pay plan for Musk in November that will give the CEO more shares and increased control over the company. The vote came after Musk threatened to potentially leave Tesla if the plan didn’t pass.\n\nCritics voiced concerns that the plan doesn’t require Musk to spend a minimum amount of time on his Tesla work, and that there are no limits on his political activity.\n\nWhile Tesla doesn’t break out deliveries geographically, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) showed that the company lost market share in the region in 2025.\n\nTesla’s European registrations fell 39% in the first 11 months of 2025, while Chinese rival BYD saw registrations rise 240% in Europe. Overall, battery electric vehicles were more widely embraced in Europe in 2025, amounting to around 16% of all new vehicles sold there.\n\nSome analysts project that sales of Tesla’s more affordable Model Y standard, which the company launched in October, will help the company regain ground in coming quarters.\n\nIn a note last week, analysts at Cannacord Genuity wrote that EV adoption “is rising quickly in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil, where robust consumer interest could create meaningful long-term upside for Tesla, even as it faces fierce rivalry from Chinese automakers.”\n\nBesides BYD, Tesla now faces competition from other Chinese EV makers including Xiaomi and Geely.\n\nBut Tesla is selling investors on Musk’s vision of the future, or what he calls “sustainable abundance,” more than EV sales. That vision includes robotaxis, which Musk has promised for years, and humanoid robots, which he says will someday be able to serve as factory workers, babysitters, crime stoppers and surgeons.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/tesla-tsla-q4-2025-vehicle-deliveries.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/tesla-tsla-q4-2025-vehicle-deliveries.html)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q1ziog/tesla_reports_418227_deliveries_for_the_fourth/", "score": 1711, "num_comments": 319, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author": "Puginator", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q1ziog/tesla_reports_418227_deliveries_for_the_fourth/", "flair": null, "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564537}

Why Musk’s venture could be biggest IPO ever", "selftext": "As billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk readies to take SpaceX to the public market, investors are awaiting the chance to get in on what is expected to be the biggest IPO on record.\n\n Musk said late last month that reports of the space technology company’s plans to go public this year were “accurate.” Multiple outlets reported that the IPO was in the works following a share sale valuing the firm at around $800 billion.\n\n SpaceX is reportedly looking at a value of around $1.5 trillion when it hits the public market. That would surpass the prior record set by the Saudi Aramco IPO in 2019.\n\nWall Street heavy hitters have already begun throwing their weight behind SpaceX as private investors. Baron Capital’s Ron Baron said around a quarter of his personal investments are in the company. On top of that, SpaceX is one of the largest positions in the Baron Partners Fund. It’s also the biggest holding in the ARK’s Venture Fund run by Cathie Wood.\n\nSpaceX has shown leadership in the low-earth orbit, or LEO, market, according to Jefferies. SpaceX saw a quarterly record for LEO launches at 971 in the final three months of the year, an increase of more than 30% from the prior quarter and about 70% from a year ago, the bank found. The company launched more than 3,200 satellites in 2025, a new yearly record and increase of more than 60% from the prior year.\n\nAnalyst Kevin Lin told clients that SpaceX’s launch volume is “accelerating,” while competitor Amazon. Leo is “lagging” despite entering a stable launch phase. Amazon said in November that businesses could test out its rebranded Leo product as it aimed to make up ground against Musk’s Starlink.\n\nLin said he expects the total number of launches from across companies to hit all-time highs in the near future. SpaceX’s outlook is bright for another reason: data centers. Technology moguls looking for ways to build out infrastructure to support the artificial intelligence boom are increasingly looking to firms like SpaceX that could put data centers in space, Lin said. Space data centers are expected to “drive” the total addressable market for the LEO sector, the analyst added. \n\n“In response to the surge in demand for AI computing power and the Earth’s energy bottleneck, the topic of space data centers has gained momentum,” Lin told clients. \n\nTo be sure, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said there are key problems that need to be worked out in order to effectively put data centers in space. However, Yu said he’s “encouraged” by seeing companies such as Google and OpenAI also looking at how to do this. “There are clearly technical challenges to making this a viable endeavor but these seem to be engineering constraints as opposed to physics,” Yu wrote to clients in a note last month. \n\nA bumper SpaceX IPO could further drive up the wealth for Musk. His controversial $1 trillion pay package from his electric vehicle company Tesla was approved by shareholders late last year.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q2azqr/pro_analysis_spacex_stock_debut_is_the_big_market/", "score": 38, "num_comments": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "author": "Guy_PCS", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q2azqr/pro_analysis_spacex_stock_debut_is_the_big_market/", "flair": "Company Discussion", "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564537}

I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school. The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers. I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k. I remember buying Macys, Hecla Mining, and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better. I was over trading like a mad man. This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7$ per trade during those days. Just young and dumb not really making any money. Wasting company time so no harm no foul. \n\nIn the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k. Which was basically my life savings at that point in time. I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres (tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per)  During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia. Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes. A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary (yes even at that time). I found his aspirations of self driving, AI , robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape. I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk. I remember talking to my father in law about it. “What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia?”  Too many eggs in one basket was his response. I ended  up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia. As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could. $200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares. \n\nIt has been a great ride since then. There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares. It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel\n\nto hold this long. So much bullshit -Crypto winter , Andrew Left short selling attacks, Covid selloffs, deepseek bullshit and most recently liberation day.

Energy security and strategic materials are becoming matters of national policy, and when that happens, pricing, capital flows, and valuations change structurally.\n\nThat’s why I’m concentrated in uranium and rare earth companies that sit outside China and inside Western-aligned supply chains.\n\nMy core holdings are Energy Fuels (UUUU), Cameco (CCJ), Centrus Energy (LEU), MP Materials (MP), and Lynas (LYSDY). $300k USD invested.\n\nI chose these US/US allied companies because they represent critical choke points in supply chains that the United States and the West utilities cannot easily replace. Together, they cover uranium mining, nuclear fuel conversion and enrichment, and rare earth production and processing outside of China. China controls the majority of these rare earths and, following Venezeula, supply restrictions are only going to get worse. We’re in the hoarding era….\n\nThe recent events in Venezuela are mostly being discussed as an oil story, but I think that framing misses the larger signal. Whether oil supply increases or not is secondary. The more important takeaway is geopolitical: the United States has shown it is willing to act decisively when strategic interests are involved. That reinforces a world where energy, materials, and supply chains are increasingly treated as matters of security rather than free-market commodities.\n\nImportantly, Venezuela does not pose an oversupply risk to uranium or rare earths. These markets are nothing like oil. Uranium is heavily regulated and sold primarily through long-term contracts with utilities that plan fuel needs years in advance. Rare earths require not just mining, but complex processing infrastructure that takes a decade or more to develop. There is no mechanism for sudden supply flooding in either market.\n\nHistory supports this view. During the 2006–2007 uranium bull run, prices did not rise because of speculative demand alone. They rose because utilities realized they were under-contracted in a tightening market and rushed to secure long-term supply. Once utilities began competing for material, prices moved violently and quickly, and equities re-rated far beyond what traditional valuation models anticipated. Rare earths experienced a similar dynamic a few years later when export controls and geopolitical tension exposed how fragile global supply really was. I expect a very similar situation to take place between 2026-2028. After Venezuela, the last thing China will do is flood the market with their supply leading to a supply constraint that will enable rare earths and uranium to Sky-rocket. Just look at how commodities reacted yesterday…\n\nThose episodes weren’t driven by economic growth cycles — they were driven by procurement crises. When utilities and governments fear supply disruption, they don’t negotiate for the best price; they secure supply at almost any price.\n\nThat historical lesson matters today. Nuclear power is expanding globally, enrichment capacity is constrained, and non-China rare earth supply remains limited. At the same time, geopolitical risk is rising, not falling. If tensions escalate further — particularly around Taiwan — the immediate market reaction would likely be risk-off across all assets. But the second-order effect would be a rapid acceleration of industrial policy, subsidies, and long-term contracts favoring Western-aligned suppliers of uranium and strategic materials.\n\nI’m not positioned for a short-term commodity spike. I’m positioned for a world where governments and utilities prioritize certainty of supply over cost, just as they did in prior cycles. In those environments, uranium and rare earth equities don’t behave like normal commodities — they behave like strategic infrastructure.\n\nThat’s the bet.\n\nTLDR: Geopolitical fragmentation turns uranium and rare earths into strategic assets; history shows these markets don’t reprice gradually - they reprice violently when supply security is questioned.\n\nEdit: TRUMP on LIVE NATIONAL TELEVISION JUST ANNOUNCED THEY ARE RUNNING THE COUNTRY.

But some 14 years later, BYD beat the American EV pioneer at its own game.\n\n>The Chinese car giant has overtaken Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs, according to 2025 data released by the two rivals this week.\n\n>BYD announced Thursday that it had sold 2.26 million EVs, up nearly 28% from 2024. Meanwhile, Tesla reported Friday a second straight year of declining sales: Deliveries fell 8.6% to only 1.6 million, recording the biggest annual drop in the company’s history.\n\n>BYD was able to overtake Tesla even though its EVs are not available for purchase in America, while China is Tesla’s second-largest market.\n\n>In the fourth quarter, Tesla’s sales came in at about 418,000, down 15.6% from a year earlier and an even sharper decline from record global sales in the third quarter, when American motorists were rushing to buy EVs before a $7,500 tax credit expired on October 1.\n\n>Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not report its sales by market, providing only global figures, but the US market is responsible for nearly half its revenue, according to company reports. Reports by other automakers Monday are also likely to show weak US EV sales in the final three months of 2025.\n\n>Tesla’s deliveries had grown nearly 50% a year at one point. But it reported its first drop in annual sales in 2024, posting a modest 1% decline. Its sales fell sharply in the first six months of 2025 as it faced more competition from the EV offerings of other automakers, such a BYD and legacy global automakers, as well as backlash against Musk’s political activities, which angered many potential American and European buyers.\n\n>Early in the year, when Musk was leading the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, there were regular protests outside Tesla showrooms in Europe and the United States, and some reports of vandalism against Tesla cars and sites.\n\n>The rush to take advantage of the soon-to-expire tax credit helped sales in the third quarter. But it likely brought forward purchases by some buyers who might have bought Teslas later in the year.\n\n>To try to counter the loss of the tax credit, Tesla rolled out cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars, but those versions, while costing about $5,000 less than their “premium” equivalents, also won’t travel as far on a full charge as the premium versions and lack some features.\n\n>Aggressive competition\n\n>BYD achieved the latest milestone while grappling with fierce competition and relentless price wars in its home market. The intense \\_\\_ in China has prompted the Shenzhen-based company to expand further overseas, though its low-price strategy has drawn scrutiny and led to new tariffs in some markets.\n\n>Growth in BYD’s overall sales, including EVs and hybrids, slowed to its weakest pace in five years, with more than 4.6 million vehicles sold last year – underscoring the company’s struggles in China, the world’s largest automobile market and where BYD sells the bulk of its cars.\n\n>BYD also reported profit declines for both the second and third quarters of 2025.\n\n>While China’s auto market has become less crowded in the past few years, competition remains stiff with around 150 car brands and more than 50 EV makers, according to HSBC’s research. Rivals like Geely, China’s second-largest EV maker, fast-rising competitor Leapmotor and latecomer Xiaomi, which debuted its first EV only in 2024, have gradually eroded BYD’s domestic market share.\n\n>From a peak of 35% in 2023, BYD’s market share fell to 29% in the first 11 months of 2025, according to China Passenger Car Association. In the same period last year, its sales declined more than 5%, while Geely’s surged nearly 90%.\n\n>Wang Chuanfu, BYD’s founder and CEO, attributed the slowdown in domestic sales to erosion of BYD’s technological lead and insufficient product differentiation at a December investor meeting, according to state-run media. But he added that the company would soon unveil new technologies.\n\n>Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rose 1.2% in early trading Friday. Shares closed 2025 up 18.6% for the year, as investors looked past weak sales and focused on Musk’s plans for a fleet of robotaxis and an “army” of humanoid robots that he has promised to start building soon.

You may find the presence elsewhere but it says absolutely nothing about it being usable for this (source: I know a few doctors).\n\nThis means that while Keytruda might target the 200 people out of 100... SLS drugs will barely target 1% of that.  Why do I say barely? Well because that these drugs are given to specific people... CDK-9 is effective only for people with a certain (less common) mutation and GPS is given (to my understanding) to people in remission.\n\nSo let's do simple math (before I make you even more depressed):\n\nUSD 25B ---> 1% ---> 250M (let's be optimistic and say that 80% are eligible) --> 200M\n\nBut wait it gets better... however right now my heart is pumping, pupils are needle-point sized and I need to lower the adrenaline in my bloodstream by doing the only sensible thing I learnt from Elon Musk... **low doses of ketamine.**\n\n[Unlocking my full potential](https://i.redd.it/apm2dh6tdyag1.gif)\n\nKeytruda gets administered constantly, unlike GPS which is like <20 injections. So that 200M you were looking at? Yea it's probably way lower.\n\nNow that we've got over the \"HOLY SHIT THIS THING IS WORTH BILLIONS\" let's focus on the flying ponies in front of my eyes warning me about the financials and the CEO's marketing/dilution pattern.\n\n# A Good Modern CEO is always Professional Bullshitter.\n\nIf you've ever worked as a Software Engineer you will always notice two flavors of your average SWE.\n\n1. The technical guy who actually knows shit\n2. The bullshitter who's liked, but does shit and yaps whole day\n\nThe first one if he's career driven will become a good CTO. The second one will become CEO.\n\nThis is true for every profession, reality is that CEO needs to be able to sell, especially bullshit, to keep investors happy and to bring them exit liquidity. It's all a zero-sum game. Nobody wins, especially not the poor cancer patients who are used for advertising just like white-monkeys are in China.\n\nThe CEO SLS is no different to other CEOs except that this guy is a master bullshitter. How do you become a master bullshitter? Ambiguity. Think of the (1) technical guy, he will always be precise in his formulations, because he knows what he's talking about. the (2) bullshitter will always be ambiguous because he wants to sound smart.\n\nThe CEO has a beautiful pattern of selling very ambiguous news, carefully wording them in a way that the SLS cult members (read bagholders and MLM leaders) parrot the \"actual\" but not-factual message to the masses. Just look up the recent posts on bagholder/p'n'd subreddits for SLS. It's all bullshit purposefully pushed by bots and marketing team.\n\nAfter the share price jumps high, the CEO cuts a financing deal that basically tanks the price into oblivion, not including the perpetual warrant inducement plan (which alone makes acquisition very unlikely).\n\nThe best part? The CEO gets paid heftily even though close to 50% shareholders want to lower his above-standard pay. And there's a good reason he's getting such high cash bonuses - he knows it's all bullshit.\n\nAll of this will mean that if this company gets acquired (which is unlikely) it will be sold at a discount and not a premium. Notice the pattern that even after so many dilutions the market drives the price close to $4 a share... with constantly increasing share count it's amplifying the speed at which the company's valuation grows even though they still haven't really presented anything substantial.\n\n# Let's Look at the Recent Catalyst\n\nSo what spiked the current share price above $4? Results of the REGAL study were postponed, which was seen negatively and so the CEO wrote a very ambiguous post saying something on the lines of:\n\n\"We're still waiting for more deaths so that we can conclude the study.\" Which is absolutely hilarious. Because it doesn't say anything about SLS specifically, yet people interpret it in a way that it does and that the SLS specific treatment is actually the good one (it may be, but given the pattern I doubt it will be statistically significant)\n\nThe study includes both BAT (best available treatment) and the SLS drugs. The deaths they are waiting for might well be the BAT ones, while the SLS patients have already died (grim I know). Their argument: Average BAT life expectancy is 8 months or whatever they're saying.\n\nSo why do people think it's \"good news\" for SLS? Because people think they understand statistics when they actually don't. Heck I studied it, specialized in it as a mathematician... and even I will never dare to say that I fully understand statistics. Reality is that the delay might be negative, neutral or positive.  \n**WHY?:**\n\n* Many factors come into patient selection - The study isn't the typical \"let's pick 130 people at day 1 and start our tests\" they come in different cohorts/groups\n* You have high odds of selecting the \"good group\" that could even survive 5 years with bad treatment (this can be 10-15%)\n* All the bull posts you see focus on using the average as proof that this study is going on longer than it should (which is a very misleading statistic, and using it like this is pure bullshit for gullible people)... Average needs to be understood in a way that you will have people who died after 3 months and people who lived those 5 years -> and that will average out, so just looking at number of occurred deaths is not enough to know if there is a statistical significance. Saying that the study is going longer than expected is absolute bullshit, because if you have the healthier group by accident they will survive longer, but it will also be reflected in the final statistical analysis.\n* A small sample size like this is prone to distortions, follow up studies will be needed to know if this really works or not, which btw will definitely lead to more cash burn.\n\n**But most importantly:**\n\n* BAT for AML has significantly improved... and by significantly I mean really significantly. The 8 month figure is somewhat outdated by now as it might be closer to 10-12 months. Increasing the actual statistical significance needed to be observed with GPS.\n\n# Unsustainable Cash Burn and More to Come\n\nThe cash burn of this company is insane and even if they succeed with their tests they will face even higher cash burn due to the necessary shit they need to do to get this drug approved and into production. Given their current free cash, it's more than likely that they will need to raise more money.\n\n# So Why Are You Bearish?\n\nWell I like to think of it in terms of probability / uncertainty, specifically conditional probability. (Let's denote P(event | A ) as Probability of Event conditioned by A happening) Asks yourself this, which probability is higher?:\n\n(1) P( Good News | CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad )  \n(2) P( Bad News | CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad )\n\nWhich is more likely to be true? (1) > (2) or (1) < (2)?\n\nI'm gonna go with the likelihood of bad news as probable... This doesn't mean that the drug won't work, I just am certain that they will have to raise cash no matter what and the valuation once actual funds take a look at the revenue projections won't be as high as the current valuation.\n\nThe fact that the Trump Admin is pushing for cheaper drugs, is also pretty negative for any biotech trying to get their life-saving medication out there... This isn't the \"age of biotech\" (un)fortunately.\n\nHence I'm buying puts.\n\n**NOTE:** I'm not a biochemist, I might be wrong and I'm betting only money that I'm willing to lose, so don't follow blindly, do your own DD. Also brace for this post being downvoted by the SLS gang and Indian bots. One last thing... a big middle finger fuck you to anyone who is trying to profit by using dying people as advertisement.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xul15buwdyag1.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=292f3986d4e479518690dcee02953c68b4212c9d\n\n**My position is small, because I'm locked down in other trades, sharing mostly because I like to do equity research:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/86f0tiv8eyag1.jpg?width=549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=971f62f43ea2409f69d90f4b226e6efcc0e59418\n\nEDIT: To the existing and new bots out there, the SLS cult and other believers, yes I will double down if the stock price goes up:) Answering here since I received \"very nice\" DM requests.

Not exactly an earnings play, I was actually planning to hold these longer, but especially after Micron's huge gains today, I couldn't help but want to secure my profits first before thinking about what to do next. I'm currently thinking maybe I'll buy ATM call options 6 months out on WDC, which is another company in a similar situation as Micron anyways tbh, and then hodl those for the next 3 months and see where this goes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1q2936h/micron_mu_gains/", "score": 36, "num_comments": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "author": "tugrulthelol", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1q2936h/micron_mu_gains/", "flair": "Gain", "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564614}

Here are the Best Takes and stocks", "selftext": "We’ve all read the news, but what are Trumps real motivations. What do you guys think he wants?\n\n1. Flooding the global oil supply will lower prices, or more importantly, give Trump additional control over  the global economy through the oil supply. This may potentially be used as a bargaining chip (e.g. to weaken Iranian, Russian, Chinese economies, or to strengthen the dollar through Tariff style manipulation and leverage). Funds like USO and UCO will be interesting to watch - personally i’m staying away. \n\n2. Not only does Venezuela hold oil, but it also holds lots of gold. While Gold is currently trading at all time highs (and many economies like BRICS have been stocking up on reserves), Trump may wish to crash the gold price to ‘reinforce’ the safety of the dollar. Or, again, he may wish to leverage control. I am holding IAUM, but may sell some to resize. Again interesting to watch. \n\n3. Some have also speculated a digital currency backed by tangible (potentially Venezuelan) assets - I don’t really buy this but its interesting nonetheless.\n\n4. US grid capacity shortages have been noticeable and heavy generators are already being rolled out to fuel Data Centres and AI Infrastructure. As mentioned by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, ‘massive fleets of diesel and gas’ generators (35GW massive) may help to bridge the gap until renewable energy / grid upgrades materialise. It would cost a huge amount to buy that much fuel, if only I could get it for free… I think CAT is a miss for other reasons, but GNRC and CMI might be good plays given this background. \n\n5. All of this can be very damaging to China, as well as the fact that China has been ‘renting’ Venezuelan resources through loans granting them rights to gold, oil and rare earth materials. While I don’t think that the Rare Earths are particularly significant, snubbing China is still useful for Trump in terms of resources and ego. There may be a rise in the likes of USAR…\n\nPersonally I believe that the gold price and ETFs will start to plateau, and pending Trumps actions, maybe even fall.\n\nOil ETFs will probably remain fairly stable until Trump does something, although I believe that stocks such as HAL or CVX would be solid investments over the next two years.\n\nDid i miss anything?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q3cmyi/what_does_trump_really_want_with_venezuela_here/", "score": 974, "num_comments": 600, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "author": "ahlornjtvn139", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q3cmyi/what_does_trump_really_want_with_venezuela_here/", "flair": "Industry Discussion", "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564614}

There is also an embargo and sanctions that still have not been lifted yet and this prevents any full scale operation there from any company but once the contracts are giving from the US treasury it can only make these companies stock go up further. I am looking at Halliburton HAL and Schlumberger SLB as I think these will both be excellent plays and will not be affected by oil prices as they don’t sell oil. SLB is the “brains” of the operation, SLB has the technology to detect all of Venezuelas remaining oil field, especially the oil in the hard to reach places and SLB plans the extraction and maps everything. No company has the technology SLB does. Halliburton HAL will be sent to repair the existing pipelines and pump. HAL will fix everything and they already have existing infrastructure in Venezuela. They will also support Chevrons drilling. I believe HAL could be profitable to hold for the next 6 - 12 months and SLB could be a good hold for the next 6 - 18 months. With these two companies you avoid the volatility of oil prices and the oil market getting flooded and prices dropping.\n\nOne refinery in particular I am looking at it Valero VLO, they specialize in refining Venezuela heavy crude products, this could be a good long term play as profits will spike significantly long term.\n\nAnother one to watch could be ConocoPhillips COP as they were an oil company involved in Venezuela many years ago and their equipment and assets were seized under the Moduro regime and are owed $10 billion because of this by Venezuela so I believe they will definitely get restitution.

Pipelines are 50 years old and leaking. It will take billions and years of work by companies like **Schlumberger** and **Halliburton** to get production back to 2 million barrels per day.  \n\nNow to the reffineries: \n\nThe real money in this scenario is made through the crack spread, which is the profit margin a refinery earns by turning raw crude into products like diesel and jet fuel. When cheap Venezuelan heavy oil enters the market, the input costs for complex refiners like **Valero** or **Marathon Petroleum** drop drastically. Since they sell their finished fuel at global market prices, their margins expand even if the overall price of oil is falling.\n\nLogistics: \n\nThe shift in tanker routes would be dramatic and rapid. Currently, Venezuelan oil moves on ghost tankers to Asia via secretive ship-to-ship transfers to bypass sanctions. A political shift would redirect this flow back to its natural market in the United States. Instead of a forty-day journey to China, the oil would only take four days to reach refineries in Houston or Lake Charles.

The expiration pulled some EV sales forward to the third quarter for Tesla and other automakers.\n\nEven before that, the start of 2025 was a struggle for Tesla.\n\nAfter spending heavily to propel Trump back to the White House, Musk spent the first quarter of the year leading the president’s DOGE initiative to slash the federal workforce.\n\nMusk also endorsed Germany’s extremist anti-immigrant party, AfD, and later supported British anti-Muslim and anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson. In recent weeks, Musk has called to abolish the European Union.\n\nPartly in response to Musk’s incendiary rhetoric, Tesla has faced an enduring consumer backlash in Europe and the U.S. The company hasn’t fully recovered despite introducing a new, more affordable version of its Model Y SUV in October.\n\nHowever, Tesla shares still rallied in the second half of the year, jumping 40% in the third quarter, reaching a fresh record in mid-December. Musk bought $1 billion worth of shares in September.\n\nShareholders approved a new $1 trillion pay plan for Musk in November that will give the CEO more shares and increased control over the company. The vote came after Musk threatened to potentially leave Tesla if the plan didn’t pass.\n\nCritics voiced concerns that the plan doesn’t require Musk to spend a minimum amount of time on his Tesla work, and that there are no limits on his political activity.\n\nWhile Tesla doesn’t break out deliveries geographically, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) showed that the company lost market share in the region in 2025.\n\nTesla’s European registrations fell 39% in the first 11 months of 2025, while Chinese rival BYD saw registrations rise 240% in Europe. Overall, battery electric vehicles were more widely embraced in Europe in 2025, amounting to around 16% of all new vehicles sold there.\n\nSome analysts project that sales of Tesla’s more affordable Model Y standard, which the company launched in October, will help the company regain ground in coming quarters.\n\nIn a note last week, analysts at Cannacord Genuity wrote that EV adoption “is rising quickly in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil, where robust consumer interest could create meaningful long-term upside for Tesla, even as it faces fierce rivalry from Chinese automakers.”\n\nBesides BYD, Tesla now faces competition from other Chinese EV makers including Xiaomi and Geely.\n\nBut Tesla is selling investors on Musk’s vision of the future, or what he calls “sustainable abundance,” more than EV sales. That vision includes robotaxis, which Musk has promised for years, and humanoid robots, which he says will someday be able to serve as factory workers, babysitters, crime stoppers and surgeons.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/tesla-tsla-q4-2025-vehicle-deliveries.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/tesla-tsla-q4-2025-vehicle-deliveries.html)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q1ziog/tesla_reports_418227_deliveries_for_the_fourth/", "score": 1717, "num_comments": 319, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author": "Puginator", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q1ziog/tesla_reports_418227_deliveries_for_the_fourth/", "flair": null, "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}, "ts": 1767564614}

Why Musk’s venture could be biggest IPO ever", "selftext": "As billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk readies to take SpaceX to the public market, investors are awaiting the chance to get in on what is expected to be the biggest IPO on record.\n\n Musk said late last month that reports of the space technology company’s plans to go public this year were “accurate.” Multiple outlets reported that the IPO was in the works following a share sale valuing the firm at around $800 billion.\n\n SpaceX is reportedly looking at a value of around $1.5 trillion when it hits the public market. That would surpass the prior record set by the Saudi Aramco IPO in 2019.\n\nWall Street heavy hitters have already begun throwing their weight behind SpaceX as private investors. Baron Capital’s Ron Baron said around a quarter of his personal investments are in the company. On top of that, SpaceX is one of the largest positions in the Baron Partners Fund. It’s also the biggest holding in the ARK’s Venture Fund run by Cathie Wood.\n\nSpaceX has shown leadership in the low-earth orbit, or LEO, market, according to Jefferies. SpaceX saw a quarterly record for LEO launches at 971 in the final three months of the year, an increase of more than 30% from the prior quarter and about 70% from a year ago, the bank found. The company launched more than 3,200 satellites in 2025, a new yearly record and increase of more than 60% from the prior year.\n\nAnalyst Kevin Lin told clients that SpaceX’s launch volume is “accelerating,” while competitor Amazon. Leo is “lagging” despite entering a stable launch phase. Amazon said in November that businesses could test out its rebranded Leo product as it aimed to make up ground against Musk’s Starlink.\n\nLin said he expects the total number of launches from across companies to hit all-time highs in the near future. SpaceX’s outlook is bright for another reason: data centers. Technology moguls looking for ways to build out infrastructure to support the artificial intelligence boom are increasingly looking to firms like SpaceX that could put data centers in space, Lin said. Space data centers are expected to “drive” the total addressable market for the LEO sector, the analyst added. \n\n“In response to the surge in demand for AI computing power and the Earth’s energy bottleneck, the topic of space data centers has gained momentum,” Lin told clients. \n\nTo be sure, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said there are key problems that need to be worked out in order to effectively put data centers in space. However, Yu said he’s “encouraged” by seeing companies such as Google and OpenAI also looking at how to do this. “There are clearly technical challenges to making this a viable endeavor but these seem to be engineering constraints as opposed to physics,” Yu wrote to clients in a note last month. \n\nA bumper SpaceX IPO could further drive up the wealth for Musk.

Prices are high, tech runs the show, and everyone’s talking about AI. But the reality today is very different than 2000, especially when you look under the hood.\n\nBack in the dot com bubble, a huge chunk of companies had no profits at all. A lot of them didn’t even have real products. They were valued based on clicks, website traffic, or just the idea that “the internet is the future.” When money got tighter, those companies had nothing to fall back on. They ran out of cash and went to zero.\n\nToday’s NASDAQ is led by companies that actually make insane amounts of money. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, Meta, Amazon. These aren’t hype machines. They generate real profits every single quarter. Some of them make more cash in a year than entire industries did back then.\n\nAnother big difference is how important tech is now. In 2000, tech was optional. Today it’s infrastructure. Cloud services, chips, software, and data centers run basically everything. Governments, hospitals, banks, and the military all depend on this stuff. That demand doesn’t disappear just because the economy slows down.\n\nThat doesn’t mean stocks can’t drop.
